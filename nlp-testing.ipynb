As his motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top.<br /><br />There is a standout supporting performance by Chris Cooper, a head miner, who wants his son to follow in his footsteps, but gradually comes around at film's end.<br /><br />What makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever. It is the epitome of an American story that is well done.<br /><br />Besides the science angle, we have the father-son disagreement, football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining, and the loving spirit of family.<br /><br />Why aren't pictures like this recognized more at award times?\n","Sentiment ::  1\n","Predicted ::   positive \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Review 0  ::  For one thing, he produced this movie. It has the feel of later movies with international casts that are dubbed. The opening credits tell us it was filmed in Vienna.<br /><br />Bey was a delight in the Universal adventure movies of the 1940s. He was also superb in a movie I saw maybe ten years ago but have never heard of since: \"The Amazing Mr. X.\" Maybe it was Dr. X. I remember it as a thrilling and frightening movie.<br /><br />This one is pretty wooden, unfortunately. The plot isn't easy to follow. When I got the hang of it, I was disappointed anyway.<br /><br />Francis Lederer looks great as a concert pianist. He was a very handsome leading man ten or 15 years earlier. He never really caught on as a major star, though he should have.<br /><br />This isn't terrible but it's pretty heavy going.\n","Sentiment ::  0\n","Predicted ::   negative \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Review 0  ::  Does this film suck!!

The music does'nt compliment the movie<br /><br />that well. The contrast in Music between Bobby and Upen is not highlighted that well. Great concept gone completely wrong.

A powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time.<br /><br />*SPOILER!!! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER!!*<br /><br />The main character is taken by her young, handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms. Her two jealous \"friends\" play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy. She loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop. In the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together.(in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted)\n","Sentiment ::  1\n","Predicted ::   positive \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Review 0  ::  Having enjoyed Jean Arthur in \"The Devil and Miss Jones\", my interest was peaked, so I tried sitting through this second-string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a jockey--but I didn't make it to the end. Arthur, photographed in a gauzy, movie-magazine fashion, either wants alimony from ex-husband William Powell or another shot at marriage, but I never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks (she's the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness, but once inside a morgue--like all women in these '30's comedies--she faints). William Powell reportedly had a high time working with Miss Arthur, but you'd never know it from the end result; they look awkward standing next to each other, hesitant over their banter. The actor playing Powell's valet is excruciating, and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with unease.\n","Sentiment ::  0\n","Predicted ::   negative \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Review 0  ::  I saw this in the cinema during its initial release and can only ask \"has the world gone mad?\" The seemingly overwhelming positive response is mind boggling for this poorly written, embarrasingly predictable clap trap.<br /><br />Stephan Elliot is no genius film maker as evidenced by the consistent bombs he has produced since (check out 'Welcome to Woop Woop', 'Eye of the Beholder')<br /><br />I can only assume making a film dealing with the gay/transexual culture has people assuming that to dislike the film is an offense to this sector of the populace. Aren't we smarter than that? What about an interesting script and good performances? Ok so the 3 leads do alright considering what they have to work with, but this film includes the worst performance by a child actor I have ever seen, not helped by appalling dialogue and a really lame resolution that you can see a mile off.<br /><br />This is a disappointing film and one that doesn't deserve the overblown reputation it has garnered.\n","Sentiment ::  0\n","Predicted ::   negative \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Review 0  ::  Some teen agers go to an old deserted farm house left to one of them by their dead grandfather, unaware that there had been several murders there decades earlier because their grandfather had made a pact with the devil for a good harvest- couldn't the guy have thought of something better to sell his soul for? The man's grandson and his friends are set up to be the next sacrifice, for reasons which are never explained. The stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend, the black guy with a white girlfriend, and the two lesbians have to do battle with three killer scarecrows- but, don't be tricked like I was, this isn't nearly as fun as it sounds. It's mostly just a lot of chit chat about ball kicking, dope smoking, and the lead actor complaining about never knowing his parents. The camera work is atrocious and shaky, maybe done on a hand held camcorder in some scenes, which maybe a good thing since the scarecrows look like they just came from some kid's birthday party, and apparently they could only hire two people to play the three scarecrows! Some of the best movies I've seen have been these low budget, independent horror movies, but this one is just pathetic. The cast and crew seems to have just been made up of a bunch of people who knew each other, had never acted before and had no intention of acting again, and had a few thousand dollars (I can't believe this movie cost $130.000 to make) and a weekend of free time on their hands- even the lesbian skinny dipping scene is lame.<br /><br />I think it's amusing also, that as of this writing, there is a sequel to this film which no one has even bothered adding to IMDb.<br /><br />* out of ****, and I only rate it that highly only because of the skinny dipping scene, no matter how lame it may be.\n","Sentiment ::  0\n","Predicted ::   negative \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Review 0  ::  Another movie that relies upon the trite, worn-out cliché of the mad scientist gone madder. The movie centers around a surgeon whose life's ambition is to bring the dead...back to life. I know, I know...you've never heard that one before! Of course, as all of these movies go, the experiment goes very, very wrong and creates a maniacal, bloodthirsty creature. For this promising setup, you'd think that it'd be at least a bit suspenseful. Wrong. Like many movies of this era, the idea is nice, but the execution and the script is mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I've seen (no, Abominator: the Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake)...but not one of the gems, either.\n","Sentiment ::  0\n","Predicted ::   negative \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Review 0  ::  Sorry to repeat myself over and over, but here's another great Columbo episode. I guess that's why I'm such a fan - most episodes really are great! The best episodes always have a standout feature of some sort, and in this case the murderer and his accomplice are possibly the youngest ever Columbo villains.<br /><br />After watching a lot of episodes where Columbo and his adversary act like close friends, it's good to see an episode where tempers fray and bad feelings rise to the surface. It just gives an episode a bit more drama and bite. Columbo is rapidly onto the fact that the two students who claim to be helping him are not very secretly laughing at him and feeding him false clues. He happily plays along, deliberately turning up the bumbling in front of them to make them underestimate him! But of course he knows instantly when they are talking baloney.<br /><br />The murder itself is another complicated one, along the lines of The Bye Bye Sky High IQ episode, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the intended target while providing the assassins with a seemingly watertight alibi. In the intervening years between 1978 and 1990, the technology has moved on from record players and firecrackers to remote control car locking systems and hidden cameras.<br /><br />Stephen Caffrey puts in a great performance as Justin Rowe, the obnoxious, spoilt student. Gary Hershberger is low-key but good as his \"yes-man\" friend Cooper Redman. And it's nice to see Robert Culp as Mr Rowe, Justin's dad.<br /><br />A very satisfying episode in all ways.\n","Sentiment ::  1\n","Predicted ::   positive \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Review 0  ::  How much longer are we to persist with this flawed belief that once a director produces great, ground-breaking work, all future work \"can't be all that bad, after all, he made such-and-such\".<br /><br />Mulholland Drive is a case in point, and is in fact unmitigated rubbish. The performances are excellent, particularly from Watts and Theroux, but a good film they do not necessarily make. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making a film unnecessarily wierd only works when it takes the audience by surprise. When the audience is expecting the film to not make sense, then the film has to have some substance to keep the audience interested. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the film, with the murder-mystery set up with lots of twists and red herrings, and then ... plop! The story decends into a quagmire of bizarre halucinations and pointless segues. Methinks Lynch realised how muddled the film was becoming, and threw in the lesbian and mastobatory scenes to the audience awake, and to stop the male viewers from standing up and leaving.<br /><br />Watching the film at the preview, I was surrounded by Lynchophiles who had no more idea of what was going on than I did, but left the theatre commenting on the \"layers and layers\" of Lynch's film-making. Excuse me but these people are the same nitwits who stand in art galleries staring at canvasses that have been painted white commenting on the \"courage of the artist at painting such a brave work\".<br /><br />Films like these are made because (a) Lynch is trading on his previous work; and (b) because people convince themselves that unintelligeable film is art, and therefore, must be good. I queried a number of the Lynchophiles about what they ACTUALLY liked in the film and only response I recieved that wasn't a broad \"layers\" type of answer was that they liked it when the \"chicks got their kit off\".<br /><br />Nuff said.\n","Sentiment ::  0\n","Predicted ::   negative \n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"]}],"source":["review, predictedReview, sentiment, ActualSentiment \n","for index in range(len(review)):\n","    print(\"Review 0  :: \", review[index])\n","    print(\"Sentiment :: \", sentiment[index] )\n","    print(\"Predicted :: \", ActualSentiment[index])\n","    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n","    "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Running on test dataset and Saving the Output"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["start1=0\n","start=start1+1\n","end  =start1+313\n","def RunOnDataset(data):\n","    sess= CreateSession()\n","    review, predictedReview, sentiment, ActualSentiment = [], [], [], []\n","    try:\n","        for index, row in data.iterrows():\n","            if index<start:\n","                continue\n","            if len(row['text'].split())<460:              \n","                testStr= \"REVIEW_ {} \".format(row['text'])\n","                text = gpt2.generate(sess,\n","                                    length=len(testStr.split()),\n","                                    temperature=0.7,\n","                                    prefix=testStr,\n","                                    truncate=\"_END_\",\n","                                    batch_size=1,\n","                                    checkpoint_dir=\"/kaggle/input/notebook867863cc1c/checkpoint\",\n","                                    nsamples=1,\n","                                    return_as_list=True\n","                                    )\n","\n","\n","                # split the text to get the predicted review sentiment\n","                splitedText = text[0].split(\"_SENTIMENTS_\")\n","                if len(splitedText) > 1:\n","                    review.append(row['text'])\n","                    sentiment.append(row['sentiments'])\n","                    predictedReview.append(splitedText[0])\n","                    ActualSentiment.append(splitedText[1])\n","                \n","            if index!=0: \n","                if index%3== 0:\n","                    print(\"Processing completed: \", index)\n","            \n","                if index%50==0:\n","                    # Save the outputs to csv \n","                    outputFile= \"testCheckPoints/output_{}.csv\".format(index)\n","                    df = pd.DataFrame({ 'review': review, 'predictedReview': predictedReview, 'sentiment': sentiment, 'ActualSentiment': ActualSentiment})\n","                    df.to_csv(outputFile, index=False)\n","\n","                if index%20== 0:\n","                    sess= Restore_Session(sess)\n","            \n","            if index==end:\n","                break \n","    \n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(\"An exception occurred\")\n","        print(e)\n","            \n","    closeSession(sess)\n","    # Save the outputs to csv\n","    outputFile= \"testCheckPoints/output_{}.csv\".format(index)\n","    df = pd.DataFrame({ 'review': review, 'predictedReview': predictedReview, 'sentiment': sentiment, 'ActualSentiment': ActualSentiment})\n","    df.to_csv(outputFile, index=False)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Main Program that run the testing "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["file_path= \"/kaggle/input/notebook867863cc1c/testReview.csv\"\n","df = pd.read_csv(file_path, header=None)\n","# delete the zeroth row with null values\n","df.columns = ['index', 'text', 'sentiments']\n","df = df.drop([0])\n","print(df)\n","RunOnDataset(df)"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
