      " confusing. Even the \"T-shirts\" were uninspiring! At the end of each \"show\", we had a \"thank you\" to the actors for their incredible roles! And I must say, that for me, is NOT the greatest feature of the DVD, it would be much more enjoyable to just look through it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In the early 1980's, one of my favorite films was \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\" This film was based on The book of the same name by Rudyard Kipling and his brother Charles. In it, a couple of humans get stuck in a \"gummy\" (a \"gulch\" or a \"cave\" in this case) and have to come to a \"magic\" (a \"factory\" or a \"dairy\" in this case) to free themselves.<br /><br />In \"Willy Wonka\", there are 3 main characters, Jack, Willie, and Alice, who go to visit their friends on the other side of the \"gummy\". They get saved by a mysterious woman in black. The girls, and the others try to stop the girl from killing them, but Jack keeps trying to kill her. They are saved by a young donkey named Willy who shows them a way back that is blocked in the other side of the gummy, where they also save the young donkey. That's when the mystery woman shows the group the \"gulch (or \"factory\") that they have escaped back to to the other side and where their friends are, who had been in the process of being gored to death, and where they have all come to. So with that said, the overall plot of this movie is well made. The acting is very good, the music keeps to the end, lots of laughs throughout and then I have to leave. A great movie and a cheap little romp. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Here we go again; The Big Short. We are now looking back to see how big the Titanic was, when the rest of the fleet would probably be in its grave. As we see in this film, with the exception of two shipwrecked survivors, it's pretty much a wash. There can only be one survivor; and, he's the only one on this film that survives to tell the tale.<br /><br />That's a pretty big story.<br /><br >And the main problem with this film is the \"dunkers\" we hear. Those are pretty decent ones. Not bad for an 80's re-make, but they shouldn't be the star of the show with all the other \"dunkers\". So, this movie is a big budget flop.<br /><br >I don't think the film had a lot of great ideas.<br /><br >For me, this has been one of the worst Titanic films. One person, that I found is responsible for this terrible movie, is Steven Rees.<br /><br >I'm glad the Titanic and the rest of the cast isn't in it anymore; you can never bring back a great movie you made.<br /><br >So, it's a shame to see The Big Short return. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film is just as good as the previous version, but this version has tons of new scenes. Not a huge change, but a substantial improvement. As for the CGI, it's nice and crisp, much like a 'real' movie. But, it's not a good movie - you can't see what the rest of them do.<br /><br >For the money, this movie is $4.99 or about £2.50 US (depending on which price you choose to pay). _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This piece of crap was one of the worst I've ever seen. The story was about a guy who goes to India to work for the CIA, and meets a girl who's been abducted by a mysterious group and they're supposed to have some kind of plan that ends up making America, Britain and all the other countries look good.<br /><br />As I read the script the first time, I thought the movie looked interesting and well made; and then I saw what the movie actually was:<br /><br />The plot is that a very mysterious group of assassins have gone and murdered people; so basically the movie was just a series of murders which were supposed to happen and everyone was getting killed.<br /><br />The acting was good in the beginning, but then the plot began to go off the rails, and at various times we could barely see the plot anymore. At the end of the movie, however, there was still the plot, so it seemed that the plot was still relevant.<br /><br />The plot was so\n",

      " being a little too much, a little too serious. I mean that when it was actually over. I would have liked to see a less \"serious\" episode. And then I would have probably been looking forward to a more relaxed and funny one. This is not a good episode to watch. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ A good film, even with a bad cast can make some enjoyable movies; This is not one. One of the most annoying things in life is the fact that most people (including myself) take your work as serious as a dog, which is to say that you must have a great eye for a certain quality of your craft. Even though you are always on top of your game, you never are good enough in any respect. You may have to wait for the next good movie to come along and then give up. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Some movies are like the way we like an old piece of artwork, or a TV cartoon; others are like we really like a new thing. I was very pleased with the 'I want' effect. I really liked the acting. Although the script on the box says that this film is for adults only, it is totally acceptable for teens.<br /><br />All in all, this film brought me out of the theater with a huge smile on my face; and you'll be glad it took so long to be released. <br /><br />Recommend this film to any and everyone, it makes a huge difference in your life. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this when it came out. I had the chance to see it and I found it just a little slow compared to the rest of the cast. The scene in the car with a cop and his kid at an amusement park was too much for me. I really wanted to scream at the whole cast (which had been pretty well acted in The Big Splash) and scream in my room and scream at them all. If you loved the original the guy is one of the best actor ever. The car chase and shooting was good as was the rest of the acting. It has some pretty good scenes. I'll definitely give out to the girl to catch her (a big disappointment for me). It is a very small gem. But if you can like it go see it. It doesn't have bad acting and it has good acting. Don't have the rights there, it's so small. I'm sure a lot more people will like this and maybe some will catch on! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ For me, it's one of those things that just gets better and better the more I watch it.<br /><br />The most difficult thing about this movie was knowing where they got it. They should have been able to find or contact somebody to get this done, because it's so great. But they keep changing their minds, to try and get ahold of the other version of the story. So I'll be waiting for that to change. The worst thing was the fact that the film has its own ending and I just can't wait for that to happen so I can see the other version of the story of what happened that night. But unfortunately, that doesn't happen. Instead of trying to solve these puzzles, everyone just gets even more involved with this thing. After what I have seen so far about such problems, it's time to call it a day. It's a shame. It is too long. I'm sure other reviewers will say something like \"it's really worth it\" but that won't work. You should just skip this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ In truth, \"Boys\" isn't a great film, as its a very small action and drama. As for the great plot twists! No doubt, this will blow up any other director. There are a lot of them and a lot of them come right at the beginning. Some of them will be introduced, some would already have been hinted at here, but some are very hard to explain. And, if you are going to watch \"Boys\" in an action and drama like this it will never work. It could've been easy! Don't ever watch this!!! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It was a pity, as I was looking forward to watch the great director finally go up against the best in their field. They must have forgotten that he has done the other two, but there were some other things I will say about the other \"Boys\", namely the beautiful score for the first half of the movie and the beautiful soundtracks for all the first half of the movie. Both of these are fantastic movies, and were made during a very fine era and even for this genre. The story was excellent, the direction was excellent and the acting was superb. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END\n",

      ", but it doesn't feel like it. It just feels like a cheap rehash of a cheesy, generic bad action movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have to admit, I have seen worse! It does have a few amusing spots that make the occasional joke at the viewer's expense, but I would rather see the film made with the same director from the same film.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I had to leave early to go out for supper after having recently discovered \"The Queen of the Desert\". The whole film has two types of jokes that go on longer than it would take to make them. This is especially true of the climax. I'm not much of a movie buff (I prefer to watch B movies, and not have popcorn in my mouth), but I couldn't have found this worse...and the jokes are, at times, a bit weak. At least the acting would at least give you the impression that it was worth it. <br /><br />In fact, aside from just being bad in every respect and not very good in any particular situation of the movie (a little boy throwing fireballs at a giant, a girl wearing rubber boots and riding on top of a car-crawler, a girl riding a motorbike in the forest) I am a bit of a \"hype-hater\".<br /><br />The only reason to stay for it is if you don't know what you're getting into. The movie is bad in every possible way - but even worse in its execution. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I've watched this film five times already and have almost three hours of it in my back pocket. I'm so glad I bought it. It's a comedy about a woman trying to escape from her abusive husband. It's full of heart and is enjoyable for all ages. So far the director and director of the production, David Vincenzani, who has made a few feature films, has a lot of skill. The production is very well done as the story progresses, giving the viewer the experience that they would like. A fantastic film that I will have a look at. I recommend everyone who's in the mood for a good laugh. I enjoyed every minute with the story and everyone else involved. This is one of those cinema gems that will appeal to those who like to see things happen from the point of view of an artist. I enjoyed every moment and would recommend watching this film again. It was very enjoyable and I can't stop laughing for the last three weeks. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In the US and elsewhere many have heard of a famous Indian film called 'Truvada' which was filmed by a group of great directors who got their start producing Indian classics with 'Jungle Fever', 'Bendigo', 'Udaya' and a bunch of other great Indian films like 'Ganesh' and many more.<br /><br />My friends and I decided to see Truvada and we had no expectations but what we got we got a very nice but uninteresting film and a few great Indian actors playing their roles. It was pretty clear that this man was not just producing Indian films to make money and was instead creating good cinema that is a true art but something to really enjoy. There were no good, big actors and very little direction but that's just what makes a good action film a fun, entertaining experience. The fight scenes are very good but there are some very good fights but not great. The music was OK. There's something of a lack of romance between the leads. The music, acting and everything else about the film makes it great if you understand the story and its importance, but if you don't you're going to be very disappointed. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ As I read this film as a child, I can't think of a movie that did it better. It is the most honest portrayal of the true side of religion that I know. I cannot say that I am happy about it but am rather surprised by it. You will not regret watching it.<br /><br />One of the great things this movie has is its realism.<br /><br />It's very realistic as it is, in fact, even more so because we never see the 'wonderful and wonderful' (God and the Virgin) in heaven. They have an actual reason for why they can't be there (they just can't be.)<br /><br />As I grew older, I started to understand that people have to go to heaven, it would be a shame for us, it is the way to heaven on Earth. It's the only way to see true God because a person who is sincere, a person with a true heart will never leave here (even if they have no spiritual gifts or abilities) and therefore will never want to leave it.\n",

      ") / (Possible ending: the protagonist, the police and others) as they make their way into some sort of underground, remote area. You can see the characters, especially the villain, moving through the atmosphere using the camera. I'm not going to bother listing every scene in the movie except one, because all I can say is that it's spectacular. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A wonderful film, and a very enjoyable one. A beautifully simple film, with an elegant and subtle cinematography and very sweet music for the soundtrack. The music is really strong and powerful, but the music is a beautiful part of the movie. <br /><br /> The cinematography is beautiful, and especially so during the night time scenes on the river. The scenery, which is a very well painted, and rich background was beautiful. All scenes of the movie, especially the ending scenes and some dramatic scenes, were well-directed and well-acted. This is a delightful movie. It has been called a classic of Asian cinema. It is also a very sentimental movie, but there is no sentimentalism to it at all. This is very interesting and very uplifting, and I was captivated at all the beautiful scenes I watched. One scene could be seen as a tribute to some famous Chinese poet or historical figure of some period, but the main motivation behind this film is to show that Chinese cinema can really be good! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is another great, much forgotten classic from the 1940s. If you have not seen the films like the others, I think you should! It is just a wonderful film and a great classic. The music in this film is wonderful, and the characters are great and real. It has a great story line with good character development. It is very funny, especially as children, and the movie, as a musical comedy, is quite entertaining as well. There are good performances in this film, and the film is not as dark to the children as some other films that I have seen. I will see this movie again when I am older. I would go so far as to say that this is a great movie for anyone and everyone to enjoy! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A great \"S\" movie that should be seen! This movie is a must see! It has such a good story, good acting, great music, great locations, and a great story line.<br /><br />This film was good for every type/season, as it deals with some kind of illness/depression, in which some children suffer and go insane. What happens to their parents/friends? Then this great movie should not come to a person without knowledge of the past! If you want to see a good \"S\" movie, get this! It brings all you can handle, all the way to great, great, great, great. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" is a fun comedy, which is one of the rarest/best of these genres. But this movie (which was never an Oscar nominee, but it did have a number of Oscar nominations) doesn't need the luck of the movie-making department any more. The whole affair seems to be a big hit, with the movie making the rounds recently. Here you have a comedy that is just fine and dandy, and then the whole mess starts to unravel.<br /><br />What you want is a good lead actor, who can be your buddy/friend, and can be the one who is supposed to be the hero, and who is actually the villain. There is not a character that does not have a flaw in a way that he is supposed to be (this could have been a very funny/tense film, had good leads, but instead the film becomes, again, a comedy of errors, with some of the lines being quite sarcastic). This movie is really a big part of the 'Punk' genre. And why should we think the \"Punk\" is about this group, who are all very stupid and unenlightened like the \"Punk\" are? <br /><br />In this movie, one of the worst things in the movie (or is this the one where I say, \"Ouch!!!\") happens. One of the main characters is a \"puppet.\" (Puppet is an idiotic way to say this, especially in the States where the use of this word was more prevalent) A puppet is a puppet is a puppet is a puppet is a puppet, all of them!<br /><br />The film becomes very predictable. And, it becomes predictable what it is going to do and how it will turn out. And, it becomes predictable what is going to happen next, and how it will be connected with the plot of the show. And, it becomes predictable what is going to happen\n",

This movie is so much trash, and as an actor, i thought this was really bad.<br /><br />and then my wife said..what movie was that? in 1/8? yes, and i said..well, i said...that is so awful..if i said that a second time i would lose it..but i just keep waiting..but all the time i keep waiting there is no break..so my wife has to help..and oh dear god..i am so bad!!....i can't even spell it..........let me just say, I did not watch this movie, but I did watch a movie called \"A Beautiful Mind\" which in my opinion is better then this. so let's stop writing this bad review, i am not bad, i am not bad. so now go change your mind..don't waste your money on this horrible movie. I have seen a lot better ones. I give it a rating of one star....and one star for the one star reviewer. I'm watching what movies are bad for now and only. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have seen the movie, with a big caveat: it was not for me. But as such, I'll give it a five. <br /><br />It's an exciting, original, enjoyable sci-fi flick that is not only enjoyable to watch, but is also a wonderful exploration into the inner workings of nature that you truly think of each time you watch it. The story is wonderfully told by the director and beautifully filmed.<br /><br />It also features a fascinating depiction of human nature in the name of science.<br /><br />I recommend this film to anybody, including the children of the director.<br /><br />The story follows a young child, whose parents have adopted him; his older brothers, played by the best actors in the movie, each have their own passions; and his father, played by Steve Guttenberg, a well-read actor at a very early age, who is a huge fan of classic Italian crime fiction and is the one who believes a good screenplay makes a great movie.<br /><br />He's right.<br /><br />There's also a story that is truly uplifting and a true sign of the times that there was such a thing as film as that in the 1960s -- it speaks of a world that was full of hope and potential. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ this movie wasn't the strongest film for me, but it wasn't bad. I have seen the original which had a lot of redeeming factors in it, and this film wasn't far off from it. It tried to make them all disappear, but didn't go all the way. All of the characters are believable, and it is so different and different from the movie it is trying to make. the movie is definitely the wrong way towards making a good movie. <br /><br />1/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ When I saw the official cover of this movie, I thought it was bad. But my problem with this movie was not the actors and the movie itself. It was the movie's plot. It had nothing to do with the original. It is like watching a bad remake. And if I wasn't watching this movie, it's sequel: I would have laughed harder!<br /><br />I'm writing this book to tell you how I would have made this movie: I would have taken everything from it. I had only a bit of time before the plane to the city to watch the news, but I thought the news was the worst.<br /><br />There's no point in calling the movies good because they haven't been released or are rated. As long as a movie doesn't get to a 0/10 rating, I say it is good. If you want to see the movie and the plot, I recommend this _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie because I saw the teaser and knew that it promised me something great, and I was right. It did. I thought it was a great, if a little bit boring, movie. It had a great cast, especially the best actor, the director, the director's daughter and the scriptwriter of the novel, but I couldn't let go of it and kept searching for the best. I was disappointed. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a pretty good film, but I can't say it was one of the better.

But I'm a sucker with a bad case of the flu.<br /><br />4/10 _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It has to be one of the least funny movies I ever saw.<br /><br />The only thing that could possibly have been funny was if The Great Lakes was real (I'm sorry but there is no way around that).<br /><br />There was absolutely no connection between the two characters, and therefore no depth to the characters.<br /><br />If this movie were filmed in a real location then it would have been much funnier.<br /><br />So I'm glad everyone got their $20 back because I sure wish they didn't make this movie.<br /><br />I like the movie a lot and it's only been out of theaters in the last five months.<br /><br />I actually have seen a lot of bad movies, and not all were terrible.<br /><br />But I've never seen a movie as bad as this one.<br /><br />The only good things were the scenery and the movie.<br /><br />The Great Lakes _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The film starts out fairly alright, with a few good performances (and it's the good ones...) but after a few scenes the viewer finds it hard to accept that in some way they have actually just been watching a movie. There is an over-acting, over-thinking script that, once executed by the directors and writers, gives up almost all any pretense of being funny.<br /><br />It took many attempts--including an impossibly stupidly silly, overly dramatic, ridiculously boring ending--to create an entertaining movie--just to finish it...which I can only guess is the purpose.<br /><br />In the end, if you want to have a laugh, try to have a laugh while watching this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I first saw The Sting several years ago. The movie is about a \"bond boy\" named Tim, a man who gets shot by a gun but survives, with a huge bullet in each of his legs in each leg. After that he has two other men, a woman and a guy from a rival company, to take him to see medical services. But a guy is trying to kill one of them from the rival company who thinks that Tim wants to be his girlfriend, by doing this he has created an illusion for Tim, that a bullet in each of his legs will explode in his head and will blow him away but, in reality one of his legs, is still alive, with each episode Tim is shown exploding with his real leg, each episode a bullet explodes where Tim's real leg would be (In his actual arm). So the director of this movie thinks that they can get him from the rival company. But they have no way to kill him, as his real bullet is still in his head, so when I watched \"The Sting\" I just got a feeling, that no one killed Tim who was dying!<br /><br />As soon as Tim started exploding in his head, his real leg would start to disappear and disappear along with it and every episode I felt another moment of Tim's real leg would go away.<br /><br />Why is this a movie? In a strange way it is like \"Man with the Screaming Heart\", with no heart to actually feel anything, but to explode in anger. I guess it is similar to A Woman under the Influence, though it is more painful. <br /><br />Overall, the movie looks okay, it is a classic British movie, and a great movie from the same director. It should be considered as one of the most well done films of the 1980s to be made in Britain. But it is a movie that needs to get a bigger theatrical release.<br /><br />8 out of 10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If you'd like to see the best \"real-world\" stories that anyone can tell, get lost in a long sea of stories. If you're looking for stories in that sort of territory -- where everyone has his own personal story -- then \"Battles\" may be a good place to start.<br /><br />I saw the movie a second time last night, and it was a much better version of the first and only version made in Hollywood by MGM and Warner Bros.<br /><br />The plot of \"Battles\" looks like it is in some kind of early '70s-era version of \"The Godfather\" except it has no story line. The only character that looks like he has really had his fill of acting, is that\n",

      "! /u/-sadness/ <br /><br />The first two episodes of the series are actually pretty good.<br /><br />The three episodes are almost all very good, and the only one that's really \"bad\" is episode 1.2 of season 2, as it introduces the most horrible characters. The others are all very good. The only episode that I've said isn't very good is episode 3. It had the biggest plot hole of all the series. And the one that I know is only for the first couple episodes. No one seems to like this series and it is very disappointing.<br /><br />The first episode was way too long, the episodes 2 and 4 were way too short, and the latter two episodes could of been cut in half to fit the first episode. It would still make this show much better. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have been a huge fan of this show since it started in 1995. When I first saw the pilot, with it's intro, I was completely blown away! But since then, I've seen it several times, and every time has been a treat. I absolutely love this show, and I don't see it as \"downton or anything\" but as a \"tune in, make up, and I'll tell you everything.\" I love the characters, the world of Dr. Dee, and his world of Dr. Dee's office, especially the way she dresses and interacts with some of the people of course.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the pilot or haven't seen it yet then watch it. If you have, make sure to watch it soon, it's better than going to the movies! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie was made by a former child actress. She had her mind made up.<br /><br />I think the worst thing about this film was that it didn't hold together well, and it's a shame. It is not an adult movie to be watched by little children. It will make little girls like the old \"Pretty in Pink\" video, it will appeal to kids who like to watch action movies, and it will draw younger kids. It won't make much sense at all.<br /><br />I think the movie was poorly edited, and it would have been nice not to have to have to worry about that film. I think this movie was a complete waste of my time. I give up! This is a movie just for kids. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ In the summer of 1995, I went to a Disney summer camp and bought this movie for £10. I was so excited and had already watched all the original Star Trek episodes with the exception of \"The Naked Gun\" episodes I rented for my dad. As soon as I opened the box, I was so pleased my dads DVD was complete. My Dad would have been delighted and I had to have the DVDs when I sold the house in 1998 which was probably a lot of fun. I was so delighted again when it came out with this movie (even though it's an episode I've been waiting to see for a long time!)<br /><br />I just love this movie. It's a great story and it was so easy to put together. It's got a good balance, which I haven't seen before, plus of course it's action comedy genre is a lot different than anything I've seen since. I think it'll go far and will be a classic of sorts. And it won't be a Disney movie because it's got some of the actors' names from the series which I've seen a few times before. I hope this movie stays that way as far as i'm concerned. The movie is so good and so easy to put together. It's almost too good. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This film is a waste of my time, so please don't let anyone else use it. I know it hasn't made it to the top of the charts because its been out for months but I felt like I had to watch this, I swear. I think one of the writers, his wife and kids are in it (and I did not watch any of the other movies) and I can't even watch the pilot without the movie feeling like a soap opera. To make a better movie I'd need a second hand copy of the pilot and some patience and a bit of patience. Oh but there was one scene in particular that made me jump in my seat. I watched it a few times and I never laughed at it again. I'll tell you how that scene was and I promise it'll make you smile. Also the script is a total waste of all my time. There are no plots to speak of or anything that makes ANY sense. It's just a bunch of filler. Not worth seeing. It's a waste of my life\n",

      "op is pretty terrible and I can say it because i saw it before i said nothing is good about it I really want to see this movie.The plot was interesting i got more and more into it the deeper the movie goes the less and less I was expecting it to be about a bunch of crazy people (which it's not).<br /><br />All the other reviewers seemed to get it very much...well it turned me totally off.<br /><br />The acting was pretty bad i just could see none of it and as you can imagine all of the actors on the movie had issues acting. I think this movie was soooo bad that it came across as a movie... _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is awful. I can't imagine there being any enjoyment in it to anyone who thinks that it's really entertaining. If you're in the mood to watch a movie, skip it if you must. If you aren't, get your money's worth and go see the film. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I recently saw this flick - I have seen movies like 'Babel' (2004) and 'Nemesis' (2002) and have to say that both of them are fine.<br /><br />But this film, from the first moment for the very first shot until the very last one, has two flaws. One is, it fails to make a subtle connection between the children's story about a \"tragic love affair\" (the story that the film takes place in a part) and the actual \"cannes\" story. What could be more obvious than the \"Cant help you in this\" message - it's just not there. Second is that the story goes on and on about so many minor details that just can't be shown unless you want to watch them. And I know you're just not supposed to be surprised with this - even if you have absolutely none expectations, you can watch it with your friends - but not watch it. Now, I say that even if the movie works, you're better off not renting it, as I didn't get the impression that it's really worthwhile after seeing the flick.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am going to say that I like this movie (though not by much). _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ A little dark, but a lot of fun. I can't understand why anyone made $12 for this! I didn't see it at any price, even less now that it's released in theaters by the big studios. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"Cave Fever\" is a movie that I found myself rooting for and cheering for even less so as I sat watching it. But I still found it to be so well acted by the entire cast. Their lines were well delivered and their characters perfectly developed through character development and back-story.<br /><br />I also noticed that in most the other reviews I had read it was being hailed as one of the 'best' romantic comedies. But in my personal opinion \"Cave Fever\" has a lot better things to worry about! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I thought this movie was so awful it made the whole family upset. It was just one of the most ridiculous movies of the week. I mean all the jokes were stupid. I'm not really going to put down my two favorite actors, but they really put forth effort to get this film made. I think this movie should be banned after this movie was released. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I don't have much appreciation for \"Seed\" film festival, but after watching \"Seed\", I still think \"Seed\" is a good film, albeit with some serious flaws. A couple of these flaws, of course, are the \"creepy\" movie scenes, such as the one where the creepy movie actors were filmed as being in the shower. Also a couple of these movies use the wrong dialogue... It doesn't make sense when the plot is all over the place and you have to deal with scenes that don't add up. I also think the acting is terrible, especially that of the creepy movie actors. This makes one wonder how someone can be so convincing as being in love with a zombie.<br /><br />So, for this film, I give it three stars! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If one considers himself lucky to have a friend like me and to have ever been exposed to this movie I would say that it is a real embarrassment to this country who have produced this movie!!! Please be careful, avoid if that in case you are about to be one of the movie audience. Also make sure you stay far away from this film. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ There is not much doubt in\n",

      " left a few people to question the authenticity of the book. It certainly wasn't worth the effort I paid for it. It was so blatantly fake that I could hardly believe what I was seeing. For the record, I didn't think that God could exist on Earth, and I don't know about you. It's not hard to see why those who have come out against this movie do so, including Hollywood. They think that anyone who says something like this is a child of the Bible, or a Christian; not to mention a Christian. They think they've found a true Christian - and maybe I've. They don't believe that God is an evil, manipulative, or violent entity, any more than I believe that the moon is the center of the universe. I believe in God, a god who loves and cares for us all. That's a religion that I, too, would very much like to have in our homes.<br /><br />(Thanks to those who read the comments. They all make me glad I read this.) _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ There was once a time where we had a very good movie experience, but the quality of the movie has now deteriorated to the point where it is difficult to believe that the movie had an overall good message. At least you have your \"story\" here. My problem is not with the plot, but with what was left out:<br /><br />- the characters don't give a damn about each other. To paraphrase the old line, if a character doesn't get his way, then there's no one to be found waiting outside for them. I know that movie is a bit extreme for kids, but we need to be adults and have some regard for when our kids are out. You need some kind of moral compass here. The movie just leaves the audience with no ideas about it, no moral compass, nothing to work with with. The only good part of the movie was the scenes with the animals, which made me smile. I can't imagine how such scenes would have worked in real life?<br /><br />- the sex scenes are really, really, very, very, very, very, very, VERY, VERY, very bad (I've seen quite a bit of porn these days...)<br /><br />- there are so many other holes in the movie, and I've never seen such a vast amount of them I could possibly name, that I feel quite proud knowing that I've seen all they had. I would feel incredibly cheated if only those who wrote this movie would work with a movie company into actually releasing me a copy of this! <br /><br />What a waste of precious time! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is brilliant, it has an epic feel and every time something happens you will know what is going to happen... It is a movie that makes you think. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ My sister bought it as she was looking for \"the movie\", she liked it as she thought it would be good or at least I could see it. But as soon as she finished watching it, she started laughing her head off! The acting was horrible, the whole movie revolved around the two main leads who, although funny, were really awful to watch (or at least I would like to see them get off their lazy asses and not laughing like you are watching 'the movie' - it's a bit too cheesy for my taste so, what ever.) And, the rest of the cast was way to annoying. It was nice to see one girl in the first scene of the movie... but then, as soon as she entered the theater, everyone in the theater knew it was her and it would have been really, really difficult... to be honest, it was too hard for me to not laugh at how bad that was!! I don't even know what the movie was about but I'm sure that if you are bored or want to laugh at some of the jokes, this movie is a great place to check out!! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ One can watch this movie and find a few amusing little points, but most of its jokes are not worth watching. This movie is a comedy, though not funny at all. I find it just plain dull. <br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone but the least apt movie aficionado; if you're only interested in seeing a very stupid movie, you may want to go find something to do while it's being done instead, like a really bad horror movie.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind you know very little about the film; if you don't look away, you'll probably leave. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I loved watching this movie when first watching it as my boyfriend could barely watch it without scratching his head at the ridiculous\n",

      " George_Zeman, a German. At the film's end, the couple are walking slowly west on the avenue in front of the film office, when a car comes up behind them. They both turn and look and see a car being driven off the street. They both look surprised at the same time, then it hits them. It then drives off into the distance. That is what I consider the greatest plot device in the film. The script, and the very idea of it, is not even slightly clever, just very clever.<br /><br />There are some good moments here, like the great ending. One of the best of the film, and what made the movie interesting. The film is not about a bunch of people in a big city in a small city. But, it's not about New York. It doesn't focus on New York City. Instead, the film focuses on the story of a guy whose city is in danger. He is living near the city with his little-known neighbor, who is the son of a prominent mayor. Their son tells him who the real villain of the film is. He doesn't know who is the villain, and he doesn't know that it's him.<br /><br />It's a fantastic film.<br /><br />8 out of 10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A lot to like about this movie. The story isn't that unbelievable. It's just hard to sit through this movie with no interest in the rest of the movie. All the cast were believable, all the actors did a good job.<br /><br />So, this is a comedy.<br /><br />All of the funny parts in the movie. The actors were convincing and, I liked the story a lot. The movie never did really go all of the way there though, I've watched half of the movie and enjoyed it better than I did the rest.<br /><br />I was in shock that I didn't get that they made it by the director at the start. I am sad for the movie that ended. It had many parts I didn't like much but I was rooting for it and watching it with many friends and friends looking on was a good way to spend an evening, it was worth it. So, this is not a comedy, I am only a fan of the film.<br /><br />I have enjoyed this little gem of a flick. Good luck with finding it and I am sure you won't be alone if you do. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ For years I have been watching the Disney Channel, which is pretty much the world's only live channel that I haven't missed. After having experienced this channel's long running, I am finally able to finally see the Disney Channel in the original, Disney animation. Disney has been given much deserved credit for animation, but this one will surely go down in history as one of the greatest Disney animated films since Tarzan. In fact, Disney has produced and distributed an animated feature that has gone far beyond being just an animated feature, it has become a cinematic experience. This film is great for all ages and I plan to rent it whenever it is available. I have been watching Disney's animated feature films since I was a child and was very much entertained, and I still remember most of the features. With a film, I am always amazed and fascinated as to how Disney made its characters (especially its animals) into living organisms and in many ways, the show works of animation have come full circle with this film. That is a true testament to Disney's great vision and talent. Many of the characters have been remade, and the stories become relevant.<br /><br />I am amazed and impressed with the animation and the story, and I can't wait to see more of the series. I have also enjoyed the characters, and the various interactions between Disney characters become even more important to the plot and characters. It is a must-see for all Disney fans and collectors. Disney is always right here, there, and done with us!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I'm surprised the film didn't win awards as a horror film. It's not the cheapest film this year, but it's cheap enough to be entertaining and it has a good, if not a little funny plot. It's not the best, but at least I got an Oscar winner in it, and that's a good oscar award. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ At the urging of his wife, Peter O'Sullivan is about to have a baby with his older wife Jennifer, as well as his friend, and has the blessing of his religious aunt, whom he had before having the baby.

      "'m the first one to acknowledge how incredibly funny this episode may have been.<br /><br />It is a shame, though, that a great deal of potential has gone to waste for this show. I am shocked that such a great show never managed to get another season. The characters are funny, with very funny lines and it is a shame that they did not get to continue. The show was always about having fun and that humor got buried between these characters.<br /><br />In the end of the episode, the other characters are given a real purpose; a purpose in the world and I believe the fans really have one.<br /><br />While it did not seem like this would be something as great as \"The New Adventures of Monkey Island\", \"The Big Cheese\" does have its good moments. It is an hour long episode but it does give a little meaning to what a silly episode it is.<br /><br />Overall, \"The Big Cheese\" is one that is not for everyone. If you like the silly episodes, \"The Big Cheek\", you're going to love this episode.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a show that gets you laughing in every character, \"The Big Cheese\" is definitely one to watch. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ You've seen this movie before and you've seen this movie again, but your can remember it better and you might like it just a little bit. Just because of the name it is like 'The Three Stooges' meets 'The Matrix' (both of which should have the ending) and so on. The story is the usual plot which you all of a sudden realise. That being said the movie never really follows it. It feels as if you're sitting in a strange room at home or college watching a TV show. It is a very very strange movie which sometimes seems like a movie but really a story about a girl, who just can't say anything or something about what is in front of her eyes. She makes you watch this because she speaks a little bit. I guess she is supposed to be an actress but she makes you think of everything and her voice is beautiful and it makes you think about everything when you watch it. In the end you realise that the movie is not about love or death, but a story about being yourself and what you should never be and what you should be. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a bad movie. I mean I am a huge fan of the Disney Channel and I was surprised when I saw this movie. But at the same time the cast was good and they were well done but it was all for show and what the acting was. It was not for show either. The movie was very bad as well though there were a lot of things. There were some parts of it that I could not watch but still this movie would be nice to see. I did not like the movie because it did not fit its plot or any of the lines they were trying to tell them. They told what you would hear and what you should say to yourself or someone who is with you for that reason. Not only bad but the movie was very bad even for a Disney Channel movie. I am still glad I did not see it but also that I went. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The most terrifying thing about Jack Torrance's \"Dead\" is it's the least suspenseful film I have ever seen. That said there were several scenes that were very interesting though the rest I would say should have been skipped.<br /><br />With the exception of \"the first murder\" which was pretty much the whole plot...<br /><br />Just because it had it's own twist in the last act it doesn't really tell you what the film is about.<br /><br />The first murder was pretty good and was a bit more interesting than the final act.<br /><br />So if you are a horror film fan like I am and have seen the other versions to enjoy and be scared, get ready to enjoy this film (or any other film for that matter) _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I'm very surprised that there were no complaints about this in the reviews at the time. My wife & I had never heard of \"The Twilight Zone\" until a friend told us. After the first episode aired we decided that the series should show up on television. And just to say a big welcome to those of us that went through the hell that the series had a few years back. When we went to see the show I was incredibly confused and shocked by the acting and the story. I would still say that the acting was so awful that it made me cringe very hard, the fact that this would come across in video stores, that it's so bad it's good for you, makes me so mad, it was really sad that it\n",

      " good and he was so cool with his voice that I felt that this was the best actor to voice the role of the protagonist so that the two of us could be on the phone. We could feel each other that you were in touch with that world. And to make a long story short, there was a boy that went through some trouble at school and ended up in jail because he was too loud and talked too much. He eventually went straight to training but was still a bad athlete at first. When he came to the NBA I was shocked because I thought he would be a good player, maybe a good guard. Then, after he left the league and joined the AAU team of our high school coach, I realized that he had talent and could do a lot better than a guard like the one that I just described. But he was also an obnoxious, annoying guy. What you need to remember is that he was a good athlete, I was just the dumb kid in a class where he played bad hockey.<br /><br />And that's why in my opinion, no one should ever be allowed to take their team into the NBA unless they can be an All-Star or two. And I'll just pray on the Lord I never see him again because he was such a great big disappointment. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie was made in the 1950's in Canada. The director is a very old and retired man (I think he is 77 now, and it's an old movie) That's why it was so badly translated, and I don't know why that is. I would have to say that there is no such director in Norway who could make a picture like this. Even if he did, it is impossible to see it. For a movie that looks like an adaptation from a novel, it's an absolute disaster. The story is ridiculous in a bad way, it's really bad. The actors are all very elderly, as some other Norwegian movies have, and there's a terrible ending. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I've always been a fan of the Coen brothers, having seen them in movies like \"Ned Kelly\" and \"Slaughter in the Sky\" and enjoyed their comedic contributions even though most of them are better known for their other films. It was on here that I heard this film was about an old friend of mine who passed away when I was a kid (and he was a really good friend and a really nice-looking guy) and he's going to be a \"niece\" for the \"napper\" of this film. Well, in order to get some revenge, we have to break all of the nappers in a bunch of the \"Napper\" ones who are living in an RV on a deserted island. But the island is haunted. It's got a very dark secret. There's a big black demon who is about to take over the place and be an evil puppetmaster over for his evil schemes. How do I start out? What you probably know already, I thought it sounded really good, and I saw the trailer for this movie and fell in love with it right away. I bought it off of eBay a few years ago and I don't think it has changed any minds, except a few people have since noticed that it was badly acted and the movie is very cheesy.<br /><br />I have been very happy that I have been the subject of this film and that I was a good guy, who was killed by an ugly, mean-looking white girl, because I wanted to kill her. I did, I killed her, but just then she turns into a black woman. I don't know why, but I know my life has been better because of it. Oh, and to the other one who wanted to save my friend, I can't tell you because I didn't really see the movie. <br /><br />The movie is actually kind of dull, with nothing in particular (or very little, in this particular case) going for it. Some of the characters are pretty boring (although the character of 'Napper' seems to be in charge here). The story about a 'napper' killing one of his \"Nippers\" can't make much sense, it makes no sense in its own particular universe, and it doesn't make sense in the world of the guy who is trying to figure things out.<br /><br />There is one really weak moment (a really dumb guy trying to figure out the mysteries of the place), and the movie manages to drag on for a while. <br /><br />I think it's a great movie, but it isn't worth watching... it is like watching a slow-motion film of a really lame black guy, and then watching him die. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ this is quite an eye-candy film.the dialogue is incredibly funny as is that which takes place\n",

      ", however, because of a really stupid ending that should have ended the entire movie. All I can say is that it sucked. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film was so bad, I am a complete jerk. This movie is more entertaining than watching the worst episode of \"The X-files\" ever made. You have all the worst dialogue ever seen on TV and you get less and less. I can almost guarantee that you will never get this movie even if you are an X-Files fan. If you watch this film, you will be entertained until the end. This film is bad....or is it that? If you have not got any taste before starting with this film, this should be a joke. I have wasted a good week and a half renting this film. I really wish so much I can get it at least for the first time, and I would rather it in front of a full house than at any other cinema. Do yourself a favour, read books, go to the toilet then waste ten minutes of your life by watching this film, and see what happens after the credits rolled. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The director and the actors are so good and so real so far the only thing I found funny in this movie is the ending. I think the writer should get more involved with other movie films (especially the ones with Anne-Marie and John Leguizamo) and concentrate more on his character. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie tonight, so i decided to rent it.<br /><br />I have to say it's really a good movie, although it's a very good movie. I would say that its not for everyone, and if you have little or no experience or don't like films you probably will hate the idea. However, I would give this movie 2 out of 10.<br /><br />On a side note the cinematography is very beautiful and really helps the movie.<br /><br />Watch this with the whole family, make it a family movie as well. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I have absolutely nothing against this movie but it should be avoided by everyone, it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen. What was the inspiration for this movie is almost unbelievable - there aren't any characters that I identify with. The story could have been much better and its all extremely dull. If someone tells you they think it might be a good idea, then maybe go see it as an idea but its worth being warned, its one of the most boring movies ever produced. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a movie about loneliness and despair. Lestat (Daniel Radcliffe) was born and raised in London and left his life alone when he was an adolescent. For nine years, he was raised with his mother and his father by his stepmother. In spite of his stepmother's constant criticism that he was just a child and that his father was a 'puppet-master', he is able to persist with the behavior of his parents as he becomes a man. He also suffers loneliness and depression as other adults see his loneliness as a failure, his father has his family's support and his stepmother has little respect for him. The movie is one for the fans of Lestat. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is based on a popular short story by J.R.R. Tolkien and an interesting thought, that the \"dark ages\" were caused by war and greed, but also an interesting thought that perhaps has some merits.<br /><br />The movie is really not a complete look back at the history of the age of mankind, but I am not going to talk about the story as such, as that is not interesting. The story of Lestat is interesting and is based on an interesting and funny thought but the movie is not the entire story. The movie has no point except for Lestat's life and the story. Most of all, I find the movie to be quite unbelievable, as most movies of this kind are. The movie does not even have a point in trying to tell, to tell an important part of the story and it was not an enjoyable one. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a movie I remember fondly but I have never seen, a movie I really enjoyed from when I was a kid and even my youngest son can't really get past it.<br /><br />I still have the DVD to play it to him, but no one I know can either. This movie shows how \"old and wise\" and \"rich\" and \"beautiful and good\" and \"old\" can become even as young and \"un\" and \"lumpy\", and in the end, how those same words are all in the same movie.<br /\n",

      " stages to the final shot in the final part of the film is not too difficult to achieve the effect with a few very simple cuts. The only drawback would be that the camera was not always fast enough in some of the scenes it was used too often. It is a shame as a viewer it is really a shame that I'm not seeing more of this type of films in the future. Anyways I give this film four stars out of a possible ten. As an overall film on the whole, it is great. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I have seen this movie a number of times myself and it has nothing to do with how i feel about any Japanese horror film in general, and it is NOT a horror film with a specific genre of the Japanese horror movies that i watch. It is simply a horror movie that is NOT a horror movie at all but a horror movie with Japanese horror elements. It was so simple that I thought about what it could be and realized that it was a horror movie, not a horror movie, NOT a horror movie at all.<br /><br />It does not do any violence because it is not a horror movie even though there is violence everywhere in this movie.<br /><br />There is no gore and it does not have nudity as another reviewer has already stated, the people in this movie have their own way of making sure the film is good for them. Not that there's anything wrong with that, i actually enjoy these horror films and I am not a big fan of most of the horror films out today but I really, really like this one. It is not scary like others have mentioned however, the most scary part of the movie is if the ghost girl does/doesn't die from the ghost she's been under in the past.<br /><br />This film is not one that you should watch if you are in any way squeamish. I mean, it is basically straight-faced and you can just be like \"What the hell?\". It is a film that should not get your family of little kids to see though and i'm not sure even your parents would be this interested in a horror movie in fact, i mean i'm sure that's just the general attitude, they might say or do something or have a reaction, but I'm sure they would not just come up to you and say \"I like horror because I want to keep my children from seeing things like this, ok, don't you want us to watch this, alright?\". _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It's easy to tell when someone has an opinion and then say something has bad things to say about it, but it's much more important to let that person know that you agree with them and they may be wrong.<br /><br />This movie was a good film for me. I think it was quite entertaining and, the way that it was done was something I've never seen before. It was a very real feeling feeling that you're watching this film without being pushed up in the film or anything.<br /><br />I don't want to give the title a negative word because it's just such a great film. But if you're a movie fan, don't forget to check this one out! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I first watched this film on cable when I was little. It stuck with me. I just think I might watch it again on DVD, but at least watch it again with my kids first. I can still remember the scene right before Dad walked in the door of the library that the family was talking about when their little boy watched it in the theater.<br /><br />The actors have been a little to short, the film looks a bit grainy, as with other films, but I think the director would actually like to have a more vivid picture of the entire cast. If I were making a film, I would usually give my actors the benefit of the doubt. This film is definitely worth your money. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The whole thing is kind of weird with the whole \"not a movie\" aspect. For example, the first 10 or so minutes of the movie are kind of silly, but when the main character opens a portal to a fantasy world of cats and horses and stuff, it's so surreal it is almost funny. I didn't see anything like this in the real world before. I can't even get my kids to believe that the cat is the cat that kills the horse, but he's a very dangerous cat. He can only be killed by someone. There is no dialogue or character development, even during the \"dream\" where everything happens. It feels weird and I didn't even believe that I heard the voice of the tiger, I've heard this voice for years and I think it was something similar, but I've never heard it.

      ", and that this film is nothing but a horrible waste of time. As one of the great reviewers said when commenting on this movie, this movie has the lowest rating I have ever seen on IMDb. This movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life.<br /><br />This movie is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. I can think of a few reasons why this film was poorly acted, poorly written, poorly directed, poorly produced, poorly done and worst of all, poorly acted and poorly written:<br /><br />1. This movie wasn't bad, but it was bad. A great deal of talent and talent was wasted and a truly terrible film on an even lower level. 2. I'm pretty sure I missed half an hour of the movie because of an awful choice of filming locations.<br /><br />What really killed me was the choice of location filming. The film had no character and no plot. The locations were just plain awful. I saw nothing but bad pictures. 3. It was bad and the film was bad. I saw nothing but bad pictures and it is not the worst film I have ever seen.<br /><br />What else? The acting was bad. Don't bother. The script for this film was so bad that they had to change the ending every three sentences.<br /><br />I've seen this movie before. I'll never know how I got out of it. There was nothing even close to funny on the cinema screen for me. For the first ten minutes, you know what you are going to see and nothing more than an obnoxious movie with bad actors. Then after that, you are so in love with the director that you have to laugh. I can still see why people like this can say so much. But there is something so much worse than that. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ After I saw this film on Channel Five when it was released, I saw other stuff. I liked it, I liked the music, and I liked the acting. I rented it and was amazed. The story is pretty short, it is a lot of fun, and it will please any fan of the genre. However, in my opinion, a couple of people might have a different idea when they see this film. It is pretty silly, and if you don't think it is a funny movie either, it is really hard to give it a 10. The characters may not be as bad as I expected, but it still got a 10. However, the comedy scenes (especially the music during the fight) could have really taken the film to another level. And I would say, I wish the director liked it, too! The only problem I have with this film is it just seems a lot like TV commercials, and it is that, because it is, the movie is very predictable. I thought some people might like this movie because they think, you'll see some weird stuff, and it will all be pretty funny. Or the film gets a little too silly and they get annoyed by it, while I do believe most people don't get annoyed with it. In my opinion it is like those commercials. It is just, it can be pretty funny, and a couple of people will get bored of it. But they may not get bored of it. But if you are a fan of the genre, and you're looking for a good film, and you think, this is a good film to see with your girlfriend, this is a really fun film to check out! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ When I started to read the book, it was a complete surprise. This is a really funny movie which really made me laugh. It's also about a man in his 50s. The guy who played the lead in the movie played a good actor, but the movie is not worth to see the main actors in the book. This is a great movie. If you enjoyed the book, then you can probably enjoy it too. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie a few times and found it to be very original. The way it approaches the issue of a gay teenager's sex life is very interesting, as it is quite unusual from the rest of the genre. <br /><br />When a woman who has a very negative view about the sexuality of men and women actually chooses to have an open and honest discussion with her boyfriend and tells him that she really loves him, and not only his fiancé but many of his entire family, he gives her an open and honest answer to all her questions. I thought this was an excellent portrayal of a lesbian's sexual relations.<br /><br />Not only is there a sense of being totally in agreement with her and her feelings and convictions, there is also a wonderful sense of openness and honesty.<br /><br />It is very interesting to watch, and I wouldn't recommend\n",

      " learn out of her. However, this did not hold up at all in later films: for instance, in the end when Zuul is forced to be with the \"bad man\" who is getting her from her house to the \"good house.\" _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This TV adaptation of the novel by R.T. Wells is the most ridiculous, and I've seen it to many times...and I'm a great fan of R.T. Wells and his novels. From the first episode I was pretty sure I wanted to leave the screening. But it turned out that if you look at the cast, it's amazing, it's a joy to watch. This is also a very good movie. The movie opens in very stylish fashion. But then as the movie progresses, it's also very creative, very clever and fun to watch for sure....it's amazing how smartly it makes sense. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It's not exactly the best of the original books, but it is far better than most of them. I have no idea why people have said it is a non-canon film. It is not canon, it is not even canon, it is totally different with a completely fresh way to introduce it. This isn't the best of his books, and it is in some ways superior to most, but, it is just different, and it was a way for the audience to feel better about the characters and their relationships. It did make me think about some of the other books, but I really think the best of them. It's not perfect, although, by the way I do think that they have some great moments in here. If for some reason you don't like this film, then skip it. But I will say that after that point I didn't mind. I didn't have much expectations for this one, but I just saw this movie on the big screen. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie in the theater in my early years, as I don't recall much else besides this story about \"L.A. Noir\" and how it makes the city great. As anyone who has watched the movie will know, the story is based on the true story of the legendary \"Ruth Lipsley.\" I first saw it when it came out, and it has been a constant memory, as I'm sure everyone who has seen this movie will remember the film. I don't think anyone, from teenagers to middle-aged, have heard of it. I just saw it during the late Eighties, and have been lucky enough to find it on video and on DVD, and the experience of having the movie on tape has been quite the shock to me. It is definitely a great film to watch on your birthday. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I haven't seen much of D. W. Griffith's films yet, but I saw this one on late-night TV (I'm not kidding here). I guess anyone who saw this had seen it before or after the opening credits. This is a film that is just fantastic.<br /><br />The music is fantastic, the cast is excellent, both the director and screenwriter are masterful, and the acting is magnificent.<br /><br />For sure if you happen to like this film, there is no way you will sit and watch this film because it does not get into any serious plot or philosophy.<br /><br />If you are like me, then you have already seen this, and the film is one that you've seen many times. If not, then you must have watched it several times.<br /><br />This movie was great! Thanks for watching!<br /><br />7/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I rented this movie on video. It seemed like it would be a great idea, but just didn't make it. The problem was the casting. I've seen some very bad actors in my time, but I think this one is bad too. And there was something about some of the other actors that was good but, I guess, very bad, but it just didn't fit into the plot at all. The story was okay, but I was really unhappy I just couldn't make a movie out of this movie. It was just a shame I couldn't. I didn't know what it was about, so maybe someone will have better luck. I think any true film fan would probably say that. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ As a fan of British TV's 'Twin Peaks' and 'Red Dwarf', I bought the DVD and was pleasantly surprised. In contrast to the stereotypes of those 'super-dense' films, there really is nothing bad to be said about this film. The plot seems to drag, with a predictable end, some rather silly and\n",

      " head to. I really liked the movie. One thing I must say, it was a really good watch!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ As usual for an American movie starring \"good\" actors, it could have been a lot better. Even better, it was made in English (English is the standard and American is the exotic or at least common). I can't honestly say this movie is great. It isn't even good, merely an exception to the rule of good films being all about Hollywood.<br /><br />It is a boring movie, I guess. The movie is poorly directed and the movie itself is a lame piece of crap. If the audience was expecting a good movie, they might have expected the worst.<br /><br />Maybe the director did what his country demands, he was the victim of what he was ordered. I could imagine he was told to remake the movie.<br /><br />After some time, I had to come to the conclusion that all American filmmakers are the victims of a system of \"big brother\" America and that the only reason they could be so bad was because they had more resources at their disposal than their \"friend\" movie makers did. Now, I could think that the director is a big liar. I could see him coming up with any excuse to make a movie, just as any American \"bad\" filmmaker could. It's a lot easier to admit that Hollywood is the biggest joke in the entire world. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I watched this in a theater and thought it was horrible. But it is true that I like bad films--I saw The Godfather with my daughters and this is better.<br /><br />So what it is going to do is make more money. More people will see it. More critics will write about it. But more people will die because they have to watch a lot of terrible films.<br /><br />This film has no redeeming qualities--the story is predictable, and the acting (and the script) are pathetic compared to the actors involved.<br /><br />If there were a better way for bad films to be made, this would be it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ You would think that the \"wicked\" people in the audience would know what kind of movie this was. There were none. They didn't know anything either about the movie, nor knew anything of the film itself. This group of people is just pathetic, sad, stupid people.<br /><br />I don't know who the director really is, other than some rich \"cahoot\" with a big ass.<br /><br />I have seen so many bad movies, many made in the 80's (and my own \"bruises\"), but never a film that I could truly say was \"worse.\" (I am a \"poker\" and I played it badly, too.)<br /><br />If you want to hear a good movie then you should watch this and not see anything else.<br /><br />If you can't believe that a high school drama was this far... I'm going to the bathroom now. (I'll try to see what people like...)<br /><br />I could go on and on about this horrible film... I'm sure it won't be worth the time. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I've always wondered if the production was a case of poor directing or the editing. In \"I Love Lucy,\" the camera movements and angles seem to be deliberate and deliberate. That is very difficult to explain. But it must be the case at this time in the life-cycle of the characters. And it did not match, as most other comments suggested, the \"feel\" of the films. Also, although it didn't fit as well as the other titles, the character and the narrative were a bit more realistic and believable.<br /><br />Still, it is very difficult to explain. What I can offer in response to the \"what was it about\" question is that the character of \"Lucy\" is very convincing. She was certainly a character with a human side. She was not a spoiled brat who was a complete fool. She was a smart, compassionate, strong woman who had a complex history with her ex-husband (who is very present), and with her three children.<br /><br />In contrast with the other titles, Lucy is portrayed more as a smart, intelligent, and powerful woman. She knows where she stands about her ex-husband (and his cheating wife), and she has lived with him for the past 12 years.<br /><br />\"A House Full of Beautiful Ladies\" is a very fine, intelligent and well-rounded film to watch. The performances were wonderful--David Duchovny, Gary Sinise, and Gary Busey. _SENTIM\n",

      " trash on the outside. There's also been the odd mistake by the cast, like the 'scamp' of a girl who has just met her future husband.<br /><br />So in the plot-heavy and generally boring end, the only thing that has me on the edge of my seat is the title. It's one of the few good things to happen from the film, but is the main reason to watch it.<br /><br />The film's cast: - David Morse - Daniel Roebuck (Drew's daughter) _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie at the Atlanta Film Fest in September. I wasn't expecting much and was really expecting a little bit of a different angle to a film that was well-established here in Atlanta in the late 1980s. I was excited to know that I had watched a film that had the characters of a group of college-aged women as they got ready for summer vacation. After seeing that I found out what would be happening next. I kept watching but I knew that I can't give the film away for that I know the plot-line.<br /><br />If you have been a film-lover throughout the early-90s and especially if you are one of the younger viewers these days you shouldn't miss this one. The story is about a group of \"old\" white women that come into the lives of the \"young\" young men they hangout with at a bar. These women are at times jealous, at others angry, and at times at her (Drew). There is a twist that surprises the audience because it wasn't foreshadowed before and that doesn't make the film much better.<br /><br />There are some decent acting that the characters have. They are not that great but they still carry their own emotions and give you a good feel if you're not used to it. <br /><br />This movie does leave you disappointed if you skip this one you may be upset because it was only available on DVD by the end of 2001 and because you may know too much about the plot from the TV series. (and to avoid the same mistakes of some others) _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"The Other Side of Jack Frost\" is no slasher flick, and if I had to describe it that way, it wouldn't be hard to find, at least if you ask me. <br /><br />It has a twist, but not one that I would have ever seen coming. A twist... it's the first one of the film and yet, for some reason, I kept expecting another twist, or the movie would end. <br /><br />It isn't. The film is over-long, and there is no suspense and there's no climax that you can watch in the dark to anticipate what will happen, when the next twist comes. <br /><br />There are some decent characters and a couple of decent jokes, some scenes that hold no-one as they would like to sit around and see the end. But this is not a good film. I wouldn't be surprised if this was the last Jack Frost movie you see.<br /><br />I saw the original trailer - the one with Jack in it - and that had me at \"Wow!\" and \"That's funny!\" and all the way to \"Ohhh that'll hold me back...\". It was worth the wait. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I'd like to know the \"real\" story of this, because it is so sad for me to know the fictionalized story that was shown so many years ago.<br /><br />To start this movie off, you are probably familiar with the main character and, at that time, he is an \"old man\".<br /><br />When you read that this movie is supposed to take place in the 90s (the actual plot), this is your general idea.<br /><br />To begin, he is being taken into a mental institution as if he is someone we all have and you think \"why doesn't anyone do something about that?\". But when Jack finally finds out he is a zombie, he kills off the mentally insane man in the place of a couple of his guards, and his head is put on a spike.<br /><br />In other words, you can read it like that.<br /><br />Now, when you read it...<br /><br />1: the script is poorly written, poorly acted, poorly done, poorly executed (you do not know what happens if you don´t ask), and it is just plain bad... 2: the acting is mediocre and this film lacks the same depth and intensity that you can find in a \"real\" horror film.<br /><br />The movie is poorly produced, and I feel that when a movie is poorly made,\n",

      ".<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I remember thinking this was crap after seeing this movie. It seems like the same old old story about the poor old \"guy from the ghetto\" in need of help or help from someone. The movie begins with Mr. D'Agosto taking a stroll in the streets and being killed by police when he was supposed to be going to be selling drugs (and I think that's the end of the movie). Then the movie turns to black and takes a break at the end when the gang leader, the gangster (well, that's my guess) and the \"bad guy\" leave. There's a few scenes of the bad guy getting out of his car to run away, but I think they got scared from the end when they saw that car going a hundred miles an hour. There are some cool fight scenes and it's pretty damn funny. If you want to know what I'm talking about, check this out. I just watched a movie for the heck of it and I wish I could say how BAD it is but I can't. It's like watching a bunch of people being pushed against the front lawn of the house in the middle of the night and it was really weird. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I was not expecting to like this movie at all. But, after watching it, I realized I never really had any opinion about the characters but was curious to try them out. It was actually the first time I was ever watching a B movie. I've only just started watching it. The film, I thought, was a B movie. I liked it! It was really good and it was in the 90's, right before B hit the big screen, I know you were watching it. And there is still a good scene between D and B, but I guess I had a little bit of a \"dunno\" movie in me. Don't know if B movies are that way anymore. I found this nice family movie and I'd recommend it! But if you're not a fan of B's, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I haven't seen this movie for a long time.I don't want it,this is a good movie and a very good movie,but this one was just a bit slow because of the bad dialogue.I don't know why,but I think I missed several lines,even with 3 hands....the movie is amazing,there is a lot of things that happens that no one else is supposed to see,especially when you're a girl.And of course I'm the only people that have heard about this.So I hope they fix this in the future and make another \"Gangster\"movie.But if they won't do anything so I hope that they should make the movie in the future.I have an idea,a movie where the people don't know anything about the gangster,in a way they might not be surprised,they might not be surprised that there is a big secret at the end,but if this idea came to them,they would definitely make another one....I think they should,the directors should and everybody should do it.I hope that they should take this idea and take it to the next level. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This might be the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. It does not even follow the plot and every aspect of the movie is just wrong.<br /><br />I was trying to watch this movie all the way through thinking that it would be a great satire of the 60s but i was not.<br /><br />A movie about the '80s and it's characters and their history. This was all completely wrong.<br /><br />It is one of the worst movies i've ever seen.<br /><br />I just wish that someone would make an honest movie with a small budget. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Well, here's a bit of a low-budget flick about love. It's a funny little movie with plenty of love and lots of heart and it is a big hit. It has a great ending, although it's a little abrupt. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A good flick, no big budget, but very good in character dynamics as well. The characters are believable and believable. When you're dealing with an issue that people think you need to make something serious about, and yet it's clear that the issue was just an outgrowth of what they had a personal problem with, be honest with who you are and what you do and find that it all works. They are very good characters. A few small touches that I've noticed in the past are that one of the women is very short and the director and actresses aren't a team\n",

      " the film for any other reasons. What are the chances of this kind of a movie finding any kind of a distributor at all? And if they do find anyone who will fund the movie? _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I am really sick of writing reviews for movies. I have seen this movie 2 or 3 times, but have been waiting years for it to finally become available on DVD. I don't give a fuck what people say or think I do! It was just plain bad. Bad bad bad. Not so much a movie, but a collection of people talking about their lives, how they all feel, and what people say or think makes little or no sense. I really don't give that much crap anymore. And, if this was an old guy from the 70's, I'd be happy for him to stick it out for a while or maybe make a \"10\" rating to see what this movie is really like. But this was made for the 8 year-old me. I'm in my late teens now, and I'm ready to get my own things for another week or so, when I want my own opinions.<br /><br />What is so awful about this movie is not even in the movie itself, but in the entire world. I mean, I don't give a shit what people think! It's like they are all from the same world with the same issues! They can't even say their mind truly belongs here! When the entire world thinks this doesn't apply... well, that's a really funny sign! Maybe that's what I'm saying! When I see someone with the same problem after watching The Matrix, I think, \"What would I do instead?\"<br /><br />You see this movie on tv, and even on the shelf somewhere in your DVD box.<br /><br />Don't watch it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Although the movie is a classic of the era (and it's certainly one of the most famous and most successful movies of the time) it's an almost completely forgettable horror film with a lot of scenes not even in the film.<br /><br />Some of the best scenes are the opening shot of a guy in prison. The rest of the film's opening sequence is also quite unnerving as well. That's because one of the characters is a very unusual character and he doesn't show up much until much later in the film. He is so unusual that he comes off as a quirky, independent type of character.<br /><br />The story is fairly simple. That includes the usual elements that one might have had in a low-budget silent film: the fear of being outrun, fear of being outliving oneself, and that you could die if you made a fool of yourself.<br /><br />The main advantage I have over most films of the type (or at least those of the time) was that the performances weren't horrible. But the acting could've done a lot more there, as the whole cast wasn't exactly well rounded. Maybe that was the problem - it's too bad!<br /><br />If you really want a good horror film, and want a great one, this isn't your thing. It's not just for a Halloween night though, but for when you've already seen most of the bad ones you know they've been played out better! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is an excellent documentary with beautiful photographs and incredible insights into the life of the late Victorian artist Peter Cushing. Based on a true story, it's a beautifully acted, animated and lyrical drama which will appeal to anyone fascinated by the creative genius of the artist who created the worlds most famous works. This is a movie that has to be seen to be believed! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ There's almost not a dull moment in the entire film. Most of the characters' actions and their reactions to each other are extremely realistic, and even when the characters don't speak, everyone understands and does things exactly as they say in the script.<br /><br />The script, by the way, is in fact very well written. The actors portray people realistically who look like the people from their everyday life. Most of the characters are very sympathetic to the characters, in fact, I actually found myself cheering at times. The performances are likewise amazing, as they don't always have the most obvious comedic accents, but that's about the only difference between the roles. The characters, who are well developed and who have real stories behind them, are also incredibly sympathetic.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Japanese horror films (or you're a fan of \"Tokyo Ritter\"...), see this in your film-viewing. Or if you are a fan of anime or horror films, you'll have to see this film and enjoy it! _SENTIMENTS\n",

      " never the same. I recommend you only see this movie if you are willing to wait for something good again and again (even then it isn't an absolute waste of money...) _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I guess if my guess is correct, the new series will be better. I think it has the greatest fans (and it still gets) at the age of 8.<br /><br />I think I will make another comment shortly, because there is one comment I missed out on. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ One of the great films of all time, but also one of the silliest movies in the history of cinema. That's just another way to put it. In the movie it is hard to realize anything's going to happen, or for that matter if anything is going to happen. At least it has great atmosphere.<br /><br />I don't think any movie this good, I can think of one. Maybe i should see the sequel but it is so ridiculous and silly. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie has a great deal of potential with a good screenplay that could have put this movie over the top. However, the director chose not to use it (instead having someone else do it), and the writing in the scenes has a great deal of \"you couldn't tell what was going to happen next.\"<br /><br />It's also quite easy to confuse what is going in with what is supposed to be happening. Perhaps his intention was to show his love for nature. He chose to hide it and use it as a means of getting into people's heads.<br /><br />I did find the movie interesting, but it's not really worth the $2.75 you would have to pay, especially if you're not really interested in the animals.<br /><br />I tried to take this movie for what it's worth. I thought I could see the relationship building between the characters, and the love that was being shown in the film. But, it didn't come off that well.<br /><br />Overall, I really think I have to take this film a bit more seriously than this. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is one of the most underrated movies by Ingmar Bergman. The only problem I have is that there are no reviews on the site that are as good as mine.<br /><br />I must say that I found this movie a bit confusing and complicated at times. This was my main problem. The soundtrack is perfect. I must say however, that at the end of the movie, when I was finishing watching the movie, it came very close to taking away from me the last 3 hours and 40 minutes. This made me say to myself, \"It's been 4 1/2 months.\" <br /><br />Bergman has always talked about his love for the music of Beethoven. I thought I would give the film that much more attention but I was also disturbed by its use of musical cues.<br /><br />The music in this movie was never the focus of the story but what is important is the music. That does not mean the music is not important. The music that was the focus of the movie will remain out of place. As for the movie \"Beethoven\" it was a simple story about the history and evolution of Beethoven's opera. The music for the finale was good, but I thought the movie had to be improved.<br /><br />Overall, I found it a lot of fun and it had some of the best musical cues that I have seen in a movie in a long time. The characters are well done.<br /><br />7 out of 10 for this movie as a whole. I will watch it when it comes out on DVD again, I think it would be the perfect ending for the movie too. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I'm not sure if this is one of the worst movies for kids, but no matter: This movie is just terrible. I would never recommend this movie unless you're a fan of the story, the acting, the music, or the director. But if you're a fan of the story, you might just like it. This movie was just plain bad.<br /><br />The first part of the movie is a very good story; the only thing in which the film faltered was the ending. This is one of only two episodes of the TV series that have been canceled - the other two were too long and too annoying because the original pilot episode was so bad! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ In the wake of Bostock's The Ripper , the producers of this new thriller seem to have forgotten to include in their resume the old stories which brought the OZ to the screen.<br /><br />The\n",

      " about the story for this series was how people who watch it end. Why wouldn't they just keep watching? It is only a 2 hour version of the book, so it could be taken a different way. After all, it could be the one with the best storyline, but what with the book, it didn't work out that way. I would suggest watching this series more than once, just to see the whole story. I actually can't understand why people complain about the book being so great, they didn't even like it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ this film is truly the best thing about the millennium. this is the film that the late 60's and early 70's and later was the era when everything was new. the soundtrack in this film is a must see. it's the only time in my life i have heard a film soundtrack, which is why I love this film, the soundtrack is awesome, the film is one of the best films that has ever been made, the script is as well, and the acting and directing are also outstanding. you will not be disappointed by viewing this film, i believe you will enjoy every minute of it, this is the greatest movie of the decade in my opinion, it is an early 80's film and an early 80's classic. 10/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I agree with everyone who has said this movie is boring -- but that's why you like it! If you haven't seen all of the other reviews on this film -- or any of the other reviews on this film -- please do. At least you will get to see it for what it is... a classic! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie does not impress! There are lots of other reviewers who have had the good fortune of not falling for it (if you can call it a masterpiece). For once there's a movie that I can watch over and over again. No, it's not easy to find, so I'm going to ignore all the previous comments, despite their being bad (or should I say, some of them even hilarious). Anyway, this is a very good picture and the story isn't that bad. Don't expect too high of a standard here. It's really quite simple.<br /><br />I think what really makes this movie so good is the actors. They played it for what it is, pure entertainment. No plot, no suspense, no violence.<br /><br />This movie is not a classic (or even the best of the 70s), but it certainly isn't boring either and even if I had to watch it over and over again, the fact that it has no plot means that it actually is entertaining. You don't want to miss a second of it, because this movie is just so good. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I've seen so many awful movies in my time. The most recent being \"Taken\" where i'm still trying to figure it out. I was really looking forward to this one because of the fact that it was set in Venice at all. There really were not any really bad actors in it (although i would say that one would have to ask yourself what their motivations were in it), but what i found really annoying was the entire set. It was really hard to see what the characters were doing while i was there. I mean the movie is basically what it sounds. The only thing that you would like about this movie was if it had been in a more believable way that it is, but that's not something that can be taken off from a good movie. All that really shows is the stupid acting of all the actors in it. I was also surprised by how well i was able to discern what was going on in the movie as well as what characters were doing. This movie was not that great, but if you are a die hard fan of good movies then you should really enjoy it to at least try to get a bit of enjoyment out of it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I thought this was an okay movie. It wasn't as good as the original, but it was OK and a good movie. It is definitely not for everyone but I have to say it was better than almost every other film i've seen. The plot is good, but it could've been a lot more complicated. The acting isn't too bad, the characters are okay, but the story is very thin. I like movies that are more like the original, but this movie didn't have that. The acting and the plot were fine and nothing really really happened for sure. The story wasn't great either, you really don't find your own story in this one. Even though if you like good movies that are simple and just follow along with the story you could find something there to like here. That being the case, you also don't like to watch this one.\n",

      "ving in a few simple but deeply moving scenes and the music is at the top of its form.<br /><br />I loved this film so much I gave it a 10/10 rating. A big 'Thank You!'. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The movie opens with the sound of music by São Paulo, Brazil. André Pereira (Mauro) in his office is interrupted by a door opening. From there, we see the first glimpse of what are called \"spook scenes\". This is where the film really starts with a sound of music that accompanies a very strange scene. The sequence looks like a scene from, \"Lores de Zona Poder\", with the actors from that work singing their songs during a strange scene.<br /><br />The film continues until, \"La Gente ao São Paulo, (We're going there.)\". A shot from that one, of the opening shots of a city in the north of Brazil. André Pereira: \"La Gente do Zona Poder\" (\"The city where the people live in the middle of the street\") <br /><br />The film continues for several weeks until, \"The Legend of Laura del Carmen (I was told\") opens (with a song by Fernando Plummer). But the story ends. A shot from that one, of the opening of \"Silva in L.A\" (Silva is a young beautiful woman). André Pereira: \"Silva do Zona Poder\" (\"Silva there\")<br /><br />I'm not sure why was the ending cut out from the beginning. That is the film. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"The Last Flight Over a Desert.\" I'm surprised that the trailer of this movie makes the entire movie seem dull. This is one of those movies that you don't see from the trailer, but when you see it, it does have some really creepy and bizarre elements. I'm pretty sure it was never intended to be a movie that the public would actually want to see, but that's the case here. A couple of moments might make it in your mind as odd, but overall, the movie is pretty well done. In fact, the final scene where the plane goes down for real is pretty cool. Overall, it was a pretty strange movie, but the acting is pretty good for the most part with some minor acting errors. This is a movie to be kept a secret...for most people. Plus, even for those who don't have a clue, the scene with the girl being hit was really good and creepy. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ So the plot is a plot device to get around the fact that he's gay. This is also shown several times. They were too lazy to explain the gay subtext. They forgot to use the words, why he has a girlfriend? What we get is some boring gay man having an affair with an openly gay man. This was not done justice as the \"plot.\" <br /><br />I have also noticed that when I saw the trailer for this film, many parts were cut. There were also a couple of scenes where the actors would be talking. This happened because I have seen many reviews that were written in the movie description, in order to avoid spoilers. <br /><br />I'm just gonna go on the rambling and call this movie horrible and unrated. I know this is not a film to be played during a fight between two drunken teens, but still think it was awful.<br /><br />I have to give this film a \"0.\" _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The movie \"Carnosaur II\" is a great remake of the classic horror movie. It gives you a look at a typical suburban couple, but instead you will get the two most amazing features of the film: it has a story line that will surprise you for all time (the first movie i've ever watched with such an unbelievable beginning, and then the plot of the sequels)...<br /><br />The movie has very good story, there is an even plot line, and they show you the life of a very bored man(James Cagney) who doesn't care if the others like him, but to help the woman from being rejected by an old man(Jill Eikenberry).<br /><br />All the characters are quite well developed, all the action scenes are well done, the cinematography is very good...<br /><br />The movie just goes to show it does take not a lot of money to make a good movie...<br /><br />All the movie is worth watching , even if it is not a good thriller. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie is pretty stupid, but it is supposed to be.

      "REVIEW_ This movie reminded me of all of the bad television movies I have seen.<br /><br />I never laughed more when watching \"The Simpsons\" than watching this movie.<br /><br />I watched it over and over again.<br /><br />I remember watching it in high school and thinking that this movie was about to be a highlight of my life. I could feel the laughs being made and felt the atmosphere.<br /><br />When I watched the movie I felt like I was there. I felt like I would never leave that movie.<br /><br />The only negative I had was that you would have to be 17 to watch this movie.<br /><br />If you want to understand what a bad movie is, watch \"The Sopranos\" or \"Law and Order\". If you want to understand how a movie can make you laugh everytime you see it, \"The Simpsons\". _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I can think of few films to so thoroughly delight, it's sad that this one isn't one of them. But for those who don't have an idea of the kind of people the director has just got this must be a film. There's the young girl who's into sex and gets killed by the guy she likes; she's not meant to be in relationships but she gets pregnant and becomes obsessed with sex and then she's going to use a doctor, no matter how awful he looks she will always be the same. The guy she likes has a kid and then a kid also comes by. When will she stop? The man who likes her also is the same age. But the whole thing is about the same age, I'm sorry to say and with me, it's just so damn dull. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I can't think of a movie that I find a good review for with just a single comment. I would have to admit that it is somewhat good. Well, except for the fact that it is not a good movie. The plot is pretty bad, and the acting is a little better than average. The acting is good, but it is kind of lame; it has little more to do with actual dialogue than it does with yelling out \"GET OUT OF HERE!\". Maybe it is supposed to be funny, but it is not. Not even good because of the bad acting. The best part of the movie is how bad it is. I just don't know. What is really great is the way that it makes you laugh. Even if the movies not about sex, violence or any of those \"things\" in movies, it is still a very good and amusing movie. I can't believe that it's a movie that I love. I can't wait for my DVD to arrive! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I just have to say I liked this movie!!! I was really impressed by this movie..I was really bored and just had to watch this movie..it made me laugh so hard ..and when the movie finished my heart dropped...it was such a great movie..I thought to myself..\"who was that guy in the movie?\"..I was so surprised.....it was so great.... I can't believe this movie was released in 1998...it was so great!!!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It's about time this bad film comes out! This one is terrible; the script was so badly produced and written. It was all in English and I thought we were in the Middle East. But it didn't take off that way. On the way home I heard a car with two cars; they sound like the two boys in this film, and I don't like it. I don't know why I watched this film. Maybe it's a tribute to the art and nature, or maybe it's due to my curiosity. But I'm sorry. This film is worse than the first 'Dawnwalker'. I mean this film was very bad. The only thing that it is a lot more interesting are the two things. In a word: this thing is awful. This film takes about 4 months. If anyone had to watch this film, they would probably not die in an hour.....and wouldn't they? _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ A very odd title here; it could easily be a film about the evolution of technology, but what we have is a film about a man in his early years. This was probably the best film I saw for the last 20 years with the exception of The Exorcist which is definitely worthy of watching. The characters are well put together and the acting is excellent. We get to see the impact of technology on the children of old. We get to see that these children were living in the same time frame as the original D&D characters as well as new ones. If the movie is not a masterpiece, I could say '\n",

      " the movie \"The Girl from Brazil\", based on the book by Isabel Marange. I was pleasantly surprised by the acting and the cinematography of \"The Girl from Brazil\"- I saw it on DVD and I'm still not bored. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The cast is fantastic; it's the kind of movie where I can't quite figure out where to start.<br /><br />The movie opens with the news that a mysterious stranger (Chris Noth, in a cameo) is on his way to the area. What is him up to? The movie has no plot whatsoever, no beginning or ending. The only thing we get to notice is every scene with him... so we get some good glimpses of his face.<br /><br />He's quite an amazing actor, but this movie is so bland and unconvincing, I could easily see this guy putting together a movie of his own. He is the source of all this movie's fun. Why? Because it isn't a remake of the original - but it's a remake of a remake. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I just saw the trailer for this movie as I had no idea that this is one of the best horror movies ever made. I had seen the first \"Halloween\" (aka \"The Haunting)\" but this movie has something to do with that one as I first thought it was a remake of a horror movie. The movie actually takes place in the same area and stars a young girl played by the amazingly beautiful Jessica Tandy and a young man played by Jeff Fahey who is a very strange person and the film is actually very funny as well. So the first movie is actually quite cool and I thought that this could be a movie that has a good horror movie twist but instead you get a very funny thriller as well. I don't know if it is a remake but the plot could take many of the scenes of that movie and re-film them with a new setting because the direction is terrible as well. The story is quite weird and you might not agree with the overall ideas but for the time it was made it is a good movie that takes place in a really creepy environment. Overall I give it a rating of 8 out of 10 in the rating scale. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ 'What the hell was that?' 'Well I'm an explorer from the future, so I don't have anything better to do and couldn't find it anyway' 'What was it?' 'A bunch of weird stuff, apparently.' <br /><br />I can understand the appeal in making a science-fiction flick about a future society: the planet of the living dead, robots, telepaths' and zombies were all in order in this one. But, the script was just so weak and there were far too many parts that were very unconvincing that I had no sense of the characters getting killed, or really having problems. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie was one of the three best films I have seen the last ten years, one even surpassing the classics like 'Manhattan' and 'Kodak Gold'. In this film the director took a classic story and tried a 'bizarre' interpretation on it. It is one to see and enjoy.<br /><br />The acting is brilliant and I loved every scene in which the actors were in an attempt to imitate the great actors from the story. I had the joy of watching this movie. The 'stunts' were brilliant. You can tell what the audience is thinking by the number of times the audience looks in their seats.<br /><br />I also have to tell you that I fell in love with this movie when I saw it for the first time on DVD. Now I have watched it a few more times and I still can't get enough. And this is the best (I think) of this genre! I just love it! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A terrible script of boring, uninspired and trite drivel that is utterly unfunny. If you ever watched the short-lived MTV sitcom \"The X Files\", you can pretty much do what I did to the script writers-just sit around and wait for an evening show as this one was produced. Not only does that have a script (complete with plot holes and lame rehashing that will be picked up later) that's worse than \"The Outer Limits\", this kind of shows has no real interest, let alone a budget to make it interesting.<br /><br />The only thing that saved this mess from dead I was the fact that the actors have been nominated. The other acting was pretty good but the storyline was so terribly bad it's hard to feel good.<br /><br />The only saving graces of this mess were the actors and the editing, but it wasn't enough to\n",

      " it's only about the size of your hand - I wouldn't be surprised if it were at least twice the size.<br /><br />The characters are pretty dull. Most of them are cardboard but not without some charm. I found him to be boring, but I suppose the writers know - I love it when actors are as boring as they seem. I found my best friend to be annoying (because she's a comedian - and there are some who aren't), and the last 5 minutes of the story had me laughing my ass off with laughter - because the characters were so dull they couldn't have come up with something better.<br /><br />I found the movie to be terrible. I'd much rather have been shot - or killed - than watch this. It's like watching someone trying to watch their mother or father, and failing.<br /><br />Some of the scenes had the writers running around yelling at people to get off of them. I could have cared less what would happen next, but it was just plain dumb - in fact I wasn't trying to think out what the writers were going to do next... I just wanted to see what would happen... I felt like the writers wanted to make a good point... But instead they made fun of it, such was the dullness... I don't think any characters had it coming.<br /><br />I wouldn't waste your time - it's that boring. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I'll give credit to the director of the movie for trying to make a thriller out of a thriller, but I think he was way off. I would love to see this director come back with a similar movie, or an even better thriller! It doesn't really feel like a thriller to me at all. It feels more like a kind of 'what if' thing where you watch movies and think \"what if i had done that?\", as if you were a viewer of some kind, but your thoughts come out in different ways.<br /><br />One thing that I do not like about the movie, is that I feel like it wasn't made to satisfy your 'what if' needs.<br /><br />The acting is not all that great. You have a few actors that are so funny that you wonder if they actually can perform comedy in real life. If nothing else, the actors don't have much to do in this movie.<br /><br />I felt as if the movie was not made to entertain and keep you interested or entertain you, rather it is made as entertainment. I was not fooled by the humor in the movie, because every single moment I was laughing, my hopes were higher that what I was watching will still have me laughing when the story comes to an end.<br /><br />It feels like the writer of the movie took a short story and filled it with one long commercial-ish commercial about how 'cool' that movie is and 'stupid' that people actually try to watch it. There is no tension or tension in the movie, which is a shame because you really should be paying attention, and not thinking about your favorite characters.<br /><br />I feel very sorry for the writers that these directors are given that opportunity, that chance to tell something new, and in the process we don't get the same amount of good old fashioned movies and special effects that we should.<br /><br />I know that it isn't going to be the best, but I feel as if this film should have been made on TV instead.<br /><br />There's nothing in my opinion, that makes me want to like this movie, so I won't bother. It isn't worth watching.<br /><br />I feel bad for the actor who was the only one in this movie not wearing white gloves. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ After a few episodes where my wife and I were just watching it everyday, we decided to watch it again. I really loved the movie. I enjoyed how it was written, and I enjoyed the characters. It had a great plot, and the acting was very well done. But most of all, the movie was really good! The plot line was simple, and the characters were engaging throughout. I hope to see this on HBO in January (assuming we have any internet). _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is an extremely well done movie.<br /><br />There are so many aspects of the movie which are very reminiscent of another movie of mine, ``The Last American Virgin<br /><br />If I ever watch ``Last American Virgin' or one of my other movies, I am sure the similarities I noticed between the movie and the movie of that name I think are too. The cinematography, acting, directing, composing, and overall performance in ``The Last American Virgin<br /><br />This is an extremely well done movie. It is full of style\n",

      " the \"good guys\" are out to get you. \"You guys, it's time to stop believing in everybody who votes for you.\" The movie is really not that bad and can be enjoyed by anyone. You can't go wrong with this one. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ So, I have watched this film hundreds of times. Yes, there is a decent amount of violence present, a couple of characters are not that memorable (they are portrayed as nothing more than thugs - and even those decent guys look like they can't even kick well\"), but I still like it, I think the actors are great and it is pretty good. This movie is really funny - you can see the funny side coming from a mile away.<br /><br />It's really hard to rate a movie this good - there are some great performances, but everyone does it differently. I can see a movie in Hollywood about a guy who is always doing it right, who knows what he is doing, who's always in control, who is always on time and has a sense of humour to him.<br /><br />What's special about this film though, and what makes it such an enjoyable (if very dark) watch are the three main characters. They are all great, and if you watch them at their best, you will find that you love each one of them. It would be nice to know that this movie is rated as \"R.\" _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I really disliked the character named Frank in this film because there wasn't much reason for him, it's too much of a cliché and there was no reason the characters could be named after some famous actors! I was disappointed this film isn't out yet in DVD or DVD-2. All the lines were changed to suit the clichés! I can't really think of a single redeeming quality of the movie. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, I could do better.<br /><br />I am really disappointed I wasted $6.25 going to the cinema. I didn't really pay for the ticket just to see what happened to the ladies of the town, but the movie didn't tell us anything, there were no suspense-satisfying moments, no real characters. It was just an awful film. If you're looking to see one of the best British movies before the world of big budget westerns, this is not it. It does tell the story of a woman who lives on a large estate in the south for her younger sisters, who have a house near their town centre, where they are the target of a vicious murder, by a vicious gang. They kill more than one woman and her family and then the murderer gets caught by the police.<br /><br />It was supposed to be a comedy and it's not. I did laugh at one bit of the whole thing as there was quite a few scenes and not a single one was funny, a complete waste of time. I actually think there are many British films out there that don't feature characters with any connection to the north and yet don't spoil with a story about a village, that is probably a waste of money too, the whole was only about one woman and her sisters. I know it's only a movie with British actors so no money from that, but don't waste your money on that! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Although these five children's classics were released under different names and different titles, they still share many aspects in common with each other.<br /><br />These children's stories were originally written as short stories. They later became the original films. Most of the stories have been re-edited. Some have been re-released on DVD.<br /><br />The songs in these films are not necessarily in the same repertoire.<br /><br />A new collection of songs is being prepared: A Christmas CD with most of the songs included in this new CD. If one or more of these songs has been released on the same DVD, a new DVD for this movie is being prepared.<br /><br />The new DVD will be offered as a special feature in many movie theaters.<br /><br />A number of movies have made the film versions available in DVD. These include \"The Christmas Song\", \"I Remember,\" and \"Hustle and Flow\". These are all excellent films from a number of countries.<br /><br />The re-release of some children's films has led to the re-release of others as well.

      ", the characters are so fleshed that you might think you're seeing only their emotions rather than the characters. I love it when a character breaks their own rules and kills for the cause or when one character says that she could've lived another day. If this were an easy-to-follow plot I'd consider myself a very high grade movie. However, this is nothing new.<br /><br />What is I think? The film feels like it's taken from other people's scripts. Why? I don't know! It's so fleshed in its own self that I think it just came from the screen and doesn't make any sense in its own right. The ending feels like the original script. It feels like a slap in the face to the audience, even if it is true. It's simply a great example how film-making can not be faithful to the book.<br /><br />As for the cast, their roles are just not well-rounded. This is not one of their best performances. I wouldn't see them as memorable. There is so much more to the film that I just can't put into words. It's a shame. It feels as if they had to improvise as if they didn't know how to do it.<br /><br />My opinion: I don't want to see any kind of movies again. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I'm a fan of horror movies and this one had the best rating ever! It is a very weird movie. And yes, it is an old horror story. But that doesn't make it any less fun to watch, especially if you like to imagine some crazy stories. It is extremely creepy! All the people in this movie are well known, and in many ways even more creepy: it is very, very creepy! I must have the DVD for this movie and even now I still don't know all the movie details like the plot, the actors, the special effects, etc... <br /><br />What is really creepy is that I was afraid and scared at the same time. I'm sorry to say, I got more scared at some of the scenes in this movie than other movies I have seen.<br /><br />It is a must see!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ How could i get rid of all that time thinking about my parents? By not being there. With them. I want to just leave the whole mess and see a beautiful woman who is willing to have sex. I want to think of all the things we had together, and now they are gone. What a tragedy....<br /><br />\"Laws of Motion\" is a perfect example. The story is completely uninspired and has no impact whatsoever. We could have had a good film of film-making, if they had given us the time for it. They have left the viewer with the knowledge that it feels empty. If you want something different for your family, check out \"I Love Huckabees\" by H.P. Lovecraft. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The first hour of this film is a typical horror sequel that we usually get when we're young. The problem with this film is that it has nothing to scare us, no plot, and almost no suspense! <br /><br />When the camera pans around the house and down the stairs, what we're seeing is a creepy house that looks like a ghost house. There is a woman with a scary smile who seems to be the house's tenant. It's a pretty creepy story, but it is only partially inspired by ghosts and the woman. <br /><br />If you've seen this movie before, you'll note that it has the look and sound of \"The Strangeness\" and then adds \"Ghost Train.\" <br /><br />But that is where it all comes in. These types of sequels are known as bad horror movies because they are all the same, and I wouldn't say \"The Strangeness\" is the worst one out there for this reviewer since even that one is pretty good. I just liked it more, but if you don't, just rent it on a night before bed with your kids! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I was a little surprised at how crappy a movie it was... The acting was just laughable, the action was ridiculous in every sense. It was so bad, that I literally laughed out loud! The story sounded like a real drama, like real people. I thought the movie was based on real events... I didn't believe it. I was very disappointed, but I was not the only one! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ In my opinion there are many ways to look at this movie. Not only does it have special effects and an ending, but it has a truly unique, magical and memorable plot. We\n",

      " so I don't know how this is a serious thriller.<br /><br />The best part though was seeing the new character on the cover for the DVD-set-there was nothing to recommend about these guys, or the title of the film. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is the second of three movies that Joe Buck was involved with. The first one was \"The World of Oz.\" The second one was \"The World and the World\". So how do you make an old classic and still come out with new ideas? Well there was no old to put in the new world. It was a brand new world, the one that was \"old\" by the time they made it. And it was in the world, the World of Oz, where everybody had an opportunity at one. As usual this is followed by the story of a blind old man, in need of an eye for the most part, who is getting out of his own house in the middle of the night, but still can't see because he is blind. He tries all he can to get an eye in, but he keeps falling down in the World of Oz, and it is not exactly what he expected, it is also a world where he can take the most of the things he gets to look into, and can make him do things they are never allowed to do in the World of Oz of course.<br /><br />That world was pretty much about this one guy and his vision. We have a lot of great characters in this movie, especially the blind old man. You actually start to feel as if you are rooting for him, even though the rules of it may not make sense to you from a human viewpoint. It is also fun when you see things you thought you can never see happen as the old man is getting out of his house with his eyes open, and then sees things he did a great many years ago before he was told that he was blind in this world or another.<br /><br />The film also has a little twist when you see a blind guy in his bed and then realize that the person and the bed are actually the same person. Now in this world of \"Eye of the World\" we have people like this. The end does not get in, but rather you find it at the end when everything is explained. This movie is great because there is a bit of love and love mixed up in it, which adds a lot to the movie. Some of the time they are in love but the end is totally right. This is the kind of story that will stick in your mind for a very long time. If you have a chance to rent it, I advise the young brother to watch the entire film.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw these movies at the local theater as the second batch of movies that had gone off the shelves, and they were among the more boring \"fun\" movies I had seen. I don't think I could go out on a limb and say that this movie was a complete waste of time, but I'd prefer not to think that.<br /><br />At the end of the movie I was genuinely smitten with the lead actress who was so obviously depressed by the fact that she was in this film that she couldn't even tell whether she was having a great time, or just being in a state of shock because she was acting like a raving lunatic. I loved how she was looking at her husband, who was not a good guy but a decent one in this film, a man who was an alcoholic, just one more to the list. You have the same feeling about the two guys in this film, the actor in this film who's trying to be in a scene like that, who couldn't believe that the actress was actually in this film (she was), and all the others were so obviously miserable in this film that you could almost smell the scenes coming. When the ending of the movie finally came, you just had to sigh and laugh a little and feel your heart go out for all of them, even though none of them were all that happy, and you would have loved it to see them have better times in life. The actors, it was obvious that they were so consumed by this movie, they didn't know whether they were enjoying it or not. I love the way they were all smiling when the end came.<br /><br />Just to give some of the scenes an edge to them, the scenes in which the actors were trying to do good with the material, but in fact it was hard to see, and the scenes where they were having to change things, which really added to the feeling of being in a state of confusion. I could go on and on about how I just cannot recommend this so called masterpiece of horror that was really no more than a collection of cliche scenes, a collection of stupid characters, and just another random horror/drama that did not\n",

      " a very good film... _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a really pretty and stylish movie, not that long. The plot is based on a Japanese light novel, but i think that the screenplay is more accurate.<br /><br />The music and style of this movie was well done, i thought that the soundtrack was excellent...it's very realistic.<br /><br />I especially like the fact that there is no nudity at all, which could have caused problems with American audiences at the time. I think this is what made it such a popular movie in America....a very positive story and quality! This movie is definitely worth owning, and has a great romance.<br /><br />Go out and rent this, you WILL NOT be disappointed _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It was nice to be able to sit in the family home for the first time since my parents were sick & i was 15. And to see my siblings happy, healthy & healthy... The plot was intriguing. And if you have any doubt, give my brother & I a shot at watching the whole movie with you.<br /><br />It has just about everything one would hope in a film. A great story, great cast, beautiful scenery and beautiful actresses. I was surprised that there were no big budget \"B-gore\" genre movies with the kind of gore they had in mind..(i can't give spoilers but i will say that it included at least two \"gore scenes\")<br /><br />Not to say that the movie is full but what's a movie to do, you know what i mean.. (as long as the film is in good taste for adult viewers).<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone (or anyone for that matter) who wants to see a movie in which there is not alot of gore. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I really enjoyed this movie. It doesn't take itself seriously, but that can be a good thing about it. They make it seem like a movie, not like a television show.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good, and the whole plot line is very interesting. There seems to be something about this movie that people seem to not relate to at all. It's something that no one has ever experienced before, but the film makers clearly made it seem like it was real. At least at the end, there are more viewers than the average TV show.<br /><br />I didn't know a lot about this movie before watching it, and when i saw it, i did recognize some of the characters from the original, and was impressed by the effects that they had on the characters. They did a great job with some elements of the movie, but i can not say that the characters are the only ones who really got \"stuck\" in the movie at all. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I have seen this movie at least 3 times already and am very disappointed. This movie makes me sick. I can't make up my mind if it is true or false about the actual events, but that is not the point in this movie. The fact that this movie made me angry is the point I am trying to make clear. This is not about a true story, it is about a horrible mistake made by my generation that could have been prevented by proper parenting and education. If you believe this movie is true to events, then go back to your high school and take it in hand.<br /><br />I am very sad that this movie was allowed to make it to the big screen. I've seen the movie a long time ago and never heard a complaint from anyone about this movie. I'm just glad that I won't be forced to see this movie again. People in this country should not go back to school class, or get to college, taking all of their children's education for granted so they can see what happens to us when they get a new baby or an infant. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie has a great beginning, a great middle, and then a final half hour. It's hard to tell when the last hour turns into a half hour with so many new things happening around it. It's hard to tell if anything happens at that point and the direction is lacking at best, and at that point, it's pretty hard to see where to even begin. I felt like I was watching a remake of the original film. I mean, I'll never forget the original. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a good movie just a great cast. It's a little dated, but overall a very interesting. A perfect blend of horror and action/adventure. I saw this movie on TV about 10 years ago, and had forgotten about it until I searched all the web. I have purchased all the DVDs\n",

      ", the director also has an interest in a love-interest for Marge Simpson, whose character goes around the city telling of her experience. There's also a cameo by the great Michael J. Fox, with his one-liner: \"How did this get made?\" _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The film is a series of short stories from the works of writers, artists, and performers drawn together in a one room recording studio to make a film - the idea of a soundstage was the first to come to mind when I viewed the film. The production numbers are extremely minimal and appear to be well executed and the acting is, at the time of writing, much better than most of the contemporary productions. But the film is a very entertaining \"behind the scenes\" tour. The photographs are incredible, and the set decor is wonderful. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I really enjoyed this movie and I have not seen the first \"The Day After Tomorrow\", but \"The Last Wish\" is a film I still like. I have all of the actors, a great cast, and loved the main character, played perfectly by Jeffrey Combs. I could see how the audience might react a lot different than I expected. Overall a movie you may have to turn on if you are a Jeff Combs freak, but he had one of those great performances. Although the ending may just made me laugh a little bit harder, if you are a Jeff Combs fan you will like this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ My sister and she is a porn star and I watch it with her. We both feel the same way but we never say because we know she is going to get in our lives, and I guess I have a lot of trouble with people because of porn. The story is about a guy who gets a job on a porn star. He works there with a woman called Kelly Preston, is there anyone out there thinking this is a good movie? Well that's what I am thinking. I don't see it for porn, I just see it for something else. I'm looking for a porn star with a REAL personality, and some talent and I don't even understand how even a porn star could do anything in this movie. They all say the same things and you can tell like the best porn you've ever seen. I guess I just don't understand why they even did this one. It wasn't the worst for me either, I had nothing else to watch. The acting was okay, I guess but it had nothing except the hot and sexy girl in the first part who is hot and sexy. The last scene was ok I guess. There are lots, lots of reviews of other reviewers who think this is a good movie. I don't think this porn movie was the worst for me but I don't get it. I don't like it when reviewers give these little movies high scores, I can see where they come from. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ One of my favorite films from the late 50's and early 60's was the great American western film, which was based about two brothers living in Texas who were not from the west but were instead from Missouri. Both brothers were ex-convicts from the west due to the fact that they were caught and sent to the penitentiaries, where they were later pardoned. Both brothers, one being William \"Bill\" Smith a lawyer and the other being Joe (William H. Macy), are out to try to keep their good name alive by trying to get out of the penitentiary, but their plans come to naught.<br /><br />The acting in this film is great, Macy makes the best of an actor that really should have been given a bigger role and the two other characters who play Bill, a blacksmith and Joe a small-time dealer, are well cast together. Macy gives a great performance as Bill, very honest, and the two make a real bickering, and very believable. The cinematography is great and the sound effects and music are awesome! This was the first western film that Macy directed! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys western films as much as I do, which was the case with me watching the film over and over again. It has great, very realistic violence as well. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie takes you to a place where you expect it to end and you think \"okay, it is so funny!\" but it actually ends up being a terrible movie. The \"chicks\" are so annoying and you end up wanting to slap them!! A couple are having an affair then the man decides \"totally won't happen\" and the woman says \"okay\" and leaves. At the end of the movie, the woman comes back and gives the man a good reason for doing it to the lady. The lady says to the man \"did I do\n",

      " heavy scenes from a film that has been made for TV and DVD.<br /><br />It's not without merit though. There's some good camera work here for sure and the acting is good, so is the writing, which isn't great. There is an occasional bit of overdone blood, but mostly it's very much a \"weird\" British comedy, although the characters are \"funny\" enough to enjoy.<br /><br />It would be nice to have seen the TV versions a long time ago, but they're clearly from different scripts.<br /><br />I'm not saying this to sound like an amateur, either. I was able to watch on my own the entire series, with a couple of people, including the writer and director, sitting next to me in the cinema. \"Oh yeah, you're right!\" If you can watch a comedy, you can watch a lot of them. In fact, you probably can watch \"Dirty Harry\" and \"This Is Spinal Tap\" on the same video without being bored. They're not far off. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The only redeeming quality in this whole production is that it's the only show that I could see coming after the first show. This was the first of three that would be broadcast, the rest in syndication. <br /><br />This show was not bad on the surface. It could easily have been entertaining for a very quick few minutes but the first episode is not what the show should have been. The first season has nothing but poor writing, plot holes a mile long and not really anything worth watching once it gets to show more than a short teaser of what to come, though it still isn't very entertaining. It's more like a short soap opera with a whole lot of talk. The characters are poorly written in what amounts to a character study, although what you do not get is more than a few brief flashbacks and I can't really remember how many but it just isn't true. As you'll have seen in a few more shows this is where the show goes to the \"hype\" it makes. A great show, but the idea is ruined when they decide to add a new show every two weeks just to make sure everybody doesn't go to crap. They try to justify this by saying it's a continuation of the series only on the strength that it's the continuation of the series, which was never the point I'm going on. I don't know what they were thinking, they should probably be ashamed. I think if it were in syndication, it would be the end and it could only be re-run by way of a weekly new show then the episodes would show more of the characters than the show and I don't think syndication would be happy with an episode I'd say a complete re-run. I guess their only hope on how some people (e.g. the fans) would watch would be by saying the first time I think, oh that's it. The characters are pretty funny but if you're like me (a person does not like a show for its own sake) you may as well just watch the show. I'm actually quite surprised the show still has people on it. One thing it does it keeps the show fresh, but I think every show we watch gets a renewed season. If it was left on the air for one season that would be quite a lot of time. So, I like it, but if I watch it again, it's a great time. I liked it even better last season, but it's on DVD now so that's sad. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Not that much is known about the man or the story, but his character is certainly compelling.<br /><br />When I saw that the man and his wife lived in an old house on the outskirts of town, I thought I must have missed something. There was an old building nearby; where my father was working in the steel business. That's where the house was. And I'd seen a movie about the town of Rochester about the same time.<br /><br />I drove to Rochester one day while on break and ended up there. The place is still dusty, and the old buildings look just like it did in 1949. There is some history worth tracking. It seems a bit strange to me that no one could have lived through the time of the man and woman who lived there. Not that it was a terribly good location for a movie (though it doesn't have an awful lot to recommend it) but that perhaps the director just didn't have the resources to try.<br /><br />On the plus side: it has the charming actress who I believe played Jane, who I never knew existed! I think I know why he didn't have a real name. That's probably reason enough for her to be called Jane.<br /><br />But again: there was an old building\n",

It reminds me of early films of the same era, like \"La Dolce Vita\", \"The Castle of Dr. Moreau\" , etc. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Just wanted to say let me know a couple things about this film. First off, some of you people don't like to be called \"judges\" on movies... So I call you out and tell you a few things. Secondly, people have asked on this if i could make any mistakes or add to the plot...well i don't think so let me fix that problem for you please. In the meantime i guess you have the basic movie and a simple plot, and all you have to do is make sure you fill in and fill in things.<br /><br />Also, this movie has the standard bad movie ending...if its a little to long and its not just a bunch of people running around, well you're still pretty bloody and bloody, but with a little more substance to it. My advice? Don't make a movie, just leave it at that. The characters were more than tolerable. As i said before: dont make a bad movie, just a silly one that doesn't add to the story or the characters. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I've been a fan of Chuck Norris all of my life. I just recently watched this movie and I totally fell in love with the movie. It really starts well, it was not a typical action flick that's just to get a quick thrills. It has so many things in it's favor. The screenplay is a perfect blend of action, suspense and humor. It's a story about people with the right attitude. So if you like to watch action movies, you'll love this movie. If you don't like it much then you'll love the comedy. And even though the movie doesn't have the humor or action of many other modern action films it was still well worth the time. I recommend this movie for any action fans in the world. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Well, in a nutshell, this is a movie that is an obvious copy of \"MAD MAX\"...it even features the same cast, a better writing staff, a better director, the same plot, and a plot with a plot of the same quality...and one thing they do is remove the soundtrack!!! No one should see this movie...what kind of message do you get when you put \"Mad Max\" in front of an obvious copy? It's not worth it. It's ridiculous and totally unfunny. A major disappointment. I have given this movie three stars because I have seen a few other movies starring such a talented cast, but they all had the same issues. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I would just like to add to the numerous negative reviews it has gotten and am so glad that it hasn't had the negative effect that this movie is having on me as a viewer.<br /><br />On a personal note I enjoyed the first film of the new wave and I had not expected to enjoy this movie any better. I am a huge fan of the first film and will look forward to the sequel and I have no idea if it will be the same way. However it has been a pleasure to watch and will continue to watch (I hope) the movie which has the unique blend of all of the elements I have mentioned. I must say it is a joy to watch and will continue to watch the movie until the end.<br /><br />I hope whoever ever did this film was successful in making the movie as enjoyable as it has been for me to watch.<br /><br />There is something about the first movie that it is so exciting you will either be glued to the TV watching the whole thing or hooked on it and that's just the way I feel after watching it. I can assure that I will not be the latter as long as I watch this movie.<br /><br />Thank you for your time _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I will have to agree that the movie was a bit confusing (I didn't seem to follow and it seemed a bit random at times) I wish they could have picked a different character/s, and have not done one of the other complaints, but in what I see, the plot was mostly a plot of a guy and chick and I am sure some people will get the story just a tad too clear. Either way I will be looking to see the sequel.<br /><br />I had read the book a while ago and I thought that was a good enough reason to watch it, but it turned out to be such a mess.<br /><br />Well, the\n",

      " his work is that of a writer for the Daily News. He gets to know his new readers and get them to enjoy his work. He gets his fans to participate in his art, to believe in his vision and to participate in the projects he creates. This film features some of his artwork including a full length painting. He also offers an artistic lecture on how it takes a long time to become a friend.<br /><br />The Film is a visual feast of a film, filled with brilliant camera work, and a beautiful soundtrack featuring such musical selections as the \"Distant Star\" and \"Distant Wind.\" The ending was a joy. The acting was superb, especially from the younger \"Kate.\" The script was great, as well. I cannot think of anyone else involved in creating a beautiful masterpiece of cinema! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a very good movie. I went to see it because the story involved the lives of the couple who was in real life when it happend; the mother and her son. The mother is a doctor(Sarah Michelle Gellar) and the son is a drug addict. I agree with other reviewers who stated that this story was told with great care and detail regarding each scene which will provide the viewer with both the sense and action of the characters. Sarah Michelle and David Duchovny do such a great job of creating the \"nice guy in bizarro\" role and make the character seem like real people rather than stereotypes. I think this movie may have been made in less than a year, just like the TV series it star David Duchovny played in. I believe the movie was a great example of how to showcase a character with a real life and not to show it as a fictional \"story\" or that will be \"funny\" next time. It is a great example of the type of movies that can bring a new meaning to \"real life.\" _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am a huge fan of this film. I am from the south of France and I will say that the plot is very interesting and good. The acting is excellent both male and female and the characters all had a very realistic quality about them. The special effects are great, with the exception of a woman who got it badly wrong in the scene where the sword is held in a man and it will fall on his hands when he uses his right hand to cut the sword to pieces. The script is not too \"hard\" about the story or the characters. However on the other hand, you may forget that there is a plot as they do not stick to it much and there are a lot of loose ends that you had to guess. Also, you also have the question of whether that woman (Lauryn) is meant to be the wife or friend of the son? (Which would be a huge mistake to make) Also, the character of the son is not believable, especially when he dies without even dying in the sword. The end is very predictable, and you have the choice between a twist that is very difficult to predict but that also brings the movie to it's knees. It is worth seeing if you have the chance. I am now on it again to see it again. If you like classical film, then you are most likely to love this film. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ What a great cast for an excellent movie - I can remember having wanted to see the series. It has been my favourite to watch on TV since I first started watching, but it's good enough to save for another, if for nothing more than a TV show. The show was good and it was well-produced for a kids' show. It had the same cast, the same characters, it gave me an episode of the Simpsons on a DVD which was actually a bit sad. It was fun and it's just that, an episode, with the main characters from the first show called 'Friends'. I recommend you to go to the library to get the DVDs of the episodes, you will find them for sale at most video shops here. It is about the show, for all the reasons mentioned above. If you want to see an episode of Friends to watch with you then go to the library. It's a good story about friends and very enjoyable as well. It's got the same cast of characters that went on to become the characters of the series, and it's also a great episode. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I don't want to go into this, and like most people, has seen the movie already. I thought this movie was terrible. No, I don't think it was good enough, but I think this movie is the reason why so many people hate movies. It was full of plot holes and I was waiting for the punchline of the punchline. No, I can't tell you something about the movie, but I can tell you that people hate\n",

      " which the movie was originally going to be released under the title \"The First Wave\". After having only watched it in its entirety, I still can't believe this movie managed to get it's money's worth. I was really pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />My Grade: A B+ _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The story of the life of the man who was known as \"The King\" of his time, is just one of the many things I can relate to through the stories I have experienced growing up. The movie is well done, and it's hard not to smile at some parts of it. The soundtrack is a little distracting though, but I'm not complaining that much. The acting is so well done, and the story has so much promise, I give it a very high score. I'm going to have to be looking for it on video or DVD in the near future. I would give this a 9/10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The King's Speech brings to bear the characteristics of its genre many years after the first and best movie had begun to appear. Although \"The Speech\" by its very nature is somewhat derivative, the film still features as many interesting bits of dialog and plot development as other movies are wont to do. The King, like the other principal characters, also has a strong desire for power, his love of money, and his inability to speak or read. The King was so obsessed with achieving his goals of \"the best time,\" that although he's a powerful individual, he could not help but feel the limits to his influence and his success.<br /><br />The King is a man of great intelligence, yet a man who is both dull and self-pitying. We know why he can't speak or read, but when it becomes clear to him that he's not going to be around for long, he becomes even duller.<br /><br />His son, Prince John, plays a role similar to Prince Albert in \"Arthur.\" In his defense, Arthur's performance may not be brilliant, but he was certainly a much better actor that the King was.<br /><br />Despite the similarity of a few characters, there were some areas of the movie that were quite different. The dialogue between the \"main characters\" was completely new. While, for example, Princess Eustace's dialogue in \"The Speech,\" we have no idea why, she is still a charming woman, and she's quite capable of using language with aplomb.<br /><br />Even from a historical perspective, the King's Speech remains interesting. The story of a young man's love for the woman he loves is one that's well worth seeing. The plot is, of course, somewhat contrived, and you're bound to think some of the bits aren't in order to make certain plot points, especially given the nature of the film. Still, the movie was just so well done, a testament to the director's talents. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie has a weird cult-effect. The movie was really scary and I thought the cast was good. It was also really sad, the only guy I loved was the guy who played Peter Parker and he was a complete asshole!! I also thought the director did a very good job, this movie was really good.<br /><br />Also the ending was really funny and I thought the director did a nice job. It was also great that they could turn Spider-man into a normal human.<br /><br />The only thing I really didn't like about this movie is that the actors were just stupid (like everyone else said). The rest of the actors acting was done very well, I liked it.<br /><br />Overall, a very entertaining and bad movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Well I caught this one at the theater yesterday and I had seen a couple of bad films (Rats, R.0) but none of them were this bad. But I saw this one, and I'm a true film fan (B-movie, horror flicks, etc) I was really in love with this movie after coming home from watching it. I also have two older sisters who thought the acting was pretty good too, I think the acting here is excellent, the special effects work is really well done. I love the \"Rats\" as I know the movie is one of their best.<br /><br />The whole movie is pretty good, I love the story line and just love the way it goes along with the acting, the story is great and the story is really good, I recommend this movie, you'll love it, I love its story and plot. Well maybe I'm a bit biased cause I like movies and movies make me like them more, well it all makes sense I guess.<br /><br />My rating is 7/\n",

      ".<br /><br />This is without doubt the film that the director and the screenplay should have given to his father for being the best father of the child. It's so very sentimental it makes you want to run away with your daughter. You can even see the director taking care not to appear like a dad.<br /><br />I think the director is the best son.<br /><br />But seriously, this movie is a movie nobody should want to watch. The main character is a clown, and the little girl is just adorable. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ i watched this movie the night after it first came out...i'm 16 and i love \"puppets \"and \"saints\"(i always wonder how many movies will ever have those kinds of characters in it, but this one blew me away...i love \"norman knight/martin king\"with such a great cast....i love other \"puppets\" like big \"dog \"(i think), \"truerica, \"the king of vampires, \"chick (the king of vampires), \"supernatural, \"carnivale and \"carnivale....i like some of these movies, but not all, but they have some good actors(like robin horn), some good lines, some great special effects(and i mean alot), and some REALLY creepy moments..even though this is an hour long movie, it's not a huge thriller/suspense show, it's just a very intriguing and suspenseful story..and some very good scenes from other movies..i really enjoy this movie...don't really see many of the movies in this genre, but this one is very creepy, funny, exciting and well designed, with very dark and scary scenes, and some good performances from all actors...some stars in this movie, i can't wait to see next time...(i think a lot of the characters from other movies in this movie, are in this one) _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a terrific movie. Very well done with a great cast. The performances by all players. From the start when Michael tries to get an advance on the mother-in-law, and gets to know her, they are all top notch. All the supporting cast (especially the doctor who, at first, is just a pawn in the movie) do great work, as though any other movies without the doctor would be a very poor movie.<br /><br />I love movies like this, because they remind me of a time where movies weren't so much about money, but more about how good and realistic the acting and characters are. It's a shame that most movies nowadays are just cheap, but it's a great lesson for the filmmakers to see how good an actor can really be when they just go in with heart and have faith in his or her ability to act. This movie teaches you how to not allow the world to judge you by your performances, and the power of belief in your abilities. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I found this \"c\" version of \"The Cat in the Hat\" quite amusing, a pity that the original, of course, is as good as this silly film. I love the sound track--a few very funny little bits, the bits you can't find in normal versions, and the ones you hear in commercials. This is one of my favorites--not only for the fun with which it's played, but also for the quality of the actors--all of which I heard were excellent in acting. This is one of the best silent comedies of the '20s, but it's not a complete one--especially in the last third. The plot is silly (of course) and involves some kind of telepathic thing with a cat and some humans--both of which are good actors. But it's interesting enough, and the cat himself is rather charming. He's not in a very silly role, though. But I couldn't stop thinking of it the whole way through, because I love the dialogue, the voice delivery, and the way the characters talk. I haven't heard any of the characters speak out loud to each other, but I have no doubt that it is still possible--the voice was actually done by a cat himself. It's quite pleasant to listen to these characters, since it can't be done too much with real actors. It just keeps on coming up--like an alien or a devil. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ As usual, we have an action movie that gets worse as it has progressed. And the only reason this film can be considered as a genre film is because the acting and screenplay would require a certain type of performance: people not being actors. In his first film, Robert Downey, Jr. is not even an actor, and he plays this man with a kind of pathetic, pretentious quality\n",

      " grandish movie like this one. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is one of the stupidest I've ever seen. In it there was no dialogue because the characters kept on talking even if they did not say anything at all. The humor was so flat that they didn't realize that someone could actually go on the Internet and laugh at these characters. I mean, there were such obvious laughs in this movie. The most annoying part of it was the constant whining by the main characters. A woman had to scream at one point: \"I'm trying to be nice to this person! I have a huge heart! I've been through hell and back to you! I'm going home now.\" This line was so annoying I didn't want to keep watching it. And no, the car did not go from D.C.'s to Texas!!! I just could not wait for the car to go home. Another thing was when someone screamed \"It's a girl!\" at another character's girlfriend. (I've never been so bored inside my own car and my wife's house.) Not a bad film. But definitely not great. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a good movie, but it doesn't have the originality that the earlier one did. Most of the characters are not from the original trilogy. I haven't the original one either, but I know a lot about the Star Wars and comic-book universes, and I like the idea of \"big action\" that films from these movies often display. This movie does little to support that. The action scenes are usually small skirmishes and thus not very exciting. I also do not enjoy the constant repetition of big explosions. The first one was interesting because of the pacing. You could not imagine the space-bound battle from the previous trilogy being boring. I also did not get the impression of the big scenes from the first one being particularly great. This one however, is amazing and I hope to see more of the Star Wars-like lightsaber-fights.<br /><br />8/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This wonderful film has an amazing cast and makes an excellent introduction. It is a truly moving portrayal of the experience of a soldier returning from a tour, and how the support of family makes a real difference. Some of the moments in the film make you want to cry like the characters in the movie do, making it one of the best films I have seen.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I have not enjoyed it as others, but that is why I haven't given it a 10, for it is such a lovely and loving movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ An example of the typical horror spoof (or is it even a horror spoof?) that appeared in late '70s and early '80s exploitation films, \"Laserblast\" is an excellent example of the genre in its most simplistic form....the first time you see a horror spoof it is a true horror spoof, the second time you see it is in its most absurd form. An extremely poor imitative of the genre, yet totally funny, \"Laserblast\" is a very stupid film, a film that makes an excellent viewing at home, it does this by having a plot in the best possible manner, using the most absurd and over-the-top characters, some actors not having any charm, some truly horrid and over-the-top special effects, and it contains all the ingredients of a perfect parody of the horror genre. This movie may not be a perfect movie, and its flaws are a little more \"charismatic\" than those of \"Halloween\" and \"The Ring\", but it is a very entertaining and entertaining movie that just takes itself so seriously, that you have to laugh to yourself in anticipation of its greatness. 8/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Oh My God, My God, My God, What an awful, unbearable, unbearable, unbearable film. I couldn't bear watching it, I'm an American History teacher, and I feel deeply violated. I cannot imagine what this film would be like as a class project on my own.<br /><br />The first time I saw it again, I couldn't believe that it lasted, I would have yelled at the screen, and said, what the hell is all about? This is the worst movie I have ever seen- no, not for the first few minutes (which would have been better), but afterwards. I would give it 1 out of 5, if that were possible. When the film is over, I hope the characters will find one another, and stop shooting each other indiscriminately. Then again, I'm not even a friend of the creators. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie has very few redeeming qualities, other than it's a great plot and is based\n",

      " It really sucks. The acting is horrible. The script is even worse. <br /><br />As far as my opinion goes, this was a disappointing film.<br /><br />3 out of 10 _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ In the first 15 minutes or so I was hoping it would take a turn at being a parody of Hitchcock, and the first 10 minutes of the film were actually decent fun.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the first 15 minutes were just tedious, the second half of the film just became a slog, and the last 15 minutes, when I realized something was terribly wrong, was just incredibly boring.<br /><br />I would only encourage people to see this if they are really really bored, or if they just can't get enough of Hitchcock's work. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It's hard to comment about the picture, but it's worth seeing at least once to find out what the worst-ever acting scene looks like...I think it's the one before the \"Gremlins\" sequence, by the way.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is not very original, there's a lot of stuff missing that could have been expanded a lot, and lots of stupid stuff happens near the end of the movie that can't have been explained the whole time. But the acting is usually good, and some of the cast's acting is excellent! Especially, Edina and Annabelle's performance in the \"Wargames\" sequence, and Michael Rooker's in the first 15 minutes or so in this movie are the best parts of it, and they don't get any better!<br /><br />I can't say the last 10 minutes are too bad either, since they do add one or two interesting scenes to the plot but those don't last long. This movie is worth a watching for it alone if you're really serious or if you're looking for a fun time. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ One of the funniest movies I have ever watched!!! Great acting, a great cast, and very funny stuff!! Everyone should enjoy this movie, and I wish I was there to see this coming together!!!! I just got a videotape the other day for myself,and have watched it about 15 times, and have been so blown away that in the end it was the funniest joke in the world! It was like a big surprise!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw the movie on DVD a few days ago. I had to see it through to the end to see the last scene! I have to say that it was very funny at times. I thought it would be like an episode of the 'WizKids Original Gangster Movies', with a big budget for a few cool special effects and a lot of actors and special effects (in this case, the 'Evil Dead' series). It is, I think, the worst episode of the series. What in the hell are they seeing in these guys?!?!?! The whole time I kept looking at the clock to see if there was anything I could go through my day without laughing.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's an okay film, because I don't see a lot of good stuff, but if you're into gang movies, it's definitely a plus. If not, then you should definitely look out for the sequel to this. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I can't believe it. Even as an avid fan of the series, this is truly a horrendous movie. The reason that this movie exists is because of the excellent acting of a few of the cast (with the exception of Darrin), but really, even though this movie is extremely bad, it is absolutely hilarious watching it. It's like a bad comedy, only WAY worse. You can do worse. Maybe it should have some sort of redeeming value to this film, as the main reason to sit through it is because of Darrin and the other actors. They give truly great performances and make the movie a lot more enjoyable to watch than it would have been without them. And honestly, the main reason for watching this movie is for Darrin. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ There's a scene in the movie that is supposed to be set in the woods. The scene was supposed to take place in a forest with trees in the background. So there's a scene in the movie which has trees in the background with the same background in the rest of the movie. We see the woods at sunrise and sunset in this scene. But why this picture's on the cover of the DVD, I won't get into.<br /><br />I can only conclude that someone made this movie just to troll their collective brain. There is no meaning to anything this film. It's pointless, stupid, ridiculous\n",

I have to say that MTM is one of the most important films there. It is so sad that it isn't known to the wider world, but I must say, I enjoyed it! I just wished my Canadian friends would learn that Canadian films are of equal quality to those abroad. I also enjoyed seeing the actors again, as they usually perform to perfection. I hope they will ever make a big splash in the U.S. and worldwide! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I can honestly say at this point, this is the greatest movie I have ever seen. I have never seen a movie that I so enjoyed twice. When I first saw it, I had the urge to go see it twice, and I went to see it three times more in that time. I can honestly say that it took me until I was about 8 years-old to realize how much the real-life actors on that bus had grown from that bus. I know there is some truth to that.<br /><br />The movie is a great portrayal of a family and the feelings of the mother and son on their journeys. I have to say that the portrayal of the father wasn't so bad as it was almost like a true-life version of the people on that bus.<br /><br />A few people have commented on an inappropriate scene where the son is the only one out of the two that survived. I don't know what to make of that. <br /><br />My favorite part of the movie was when they were driving, the only other person in the back seat was the man who was a doctor and he talked to the two kids and explained how he and his wife were on a road trip from Georgia to New York. My favorite line was \"I'm going to die if I get hit by that car.\" (That part is from the film) I enjoyed watching the characters develop and get to know each other. I also really wanted to see how the people dealing with the mother and son in that story worked. I actually really liked the ending. I loved the way those little children (6 and 7) played as if they were in the movie in real life. I loved seeing what happened to the kids and how those good-hearted little kids became the monsters they were. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I went out of my way to find this film. I really do love horror films, and I don't always agree with the people who say that they're terrible, but I loved it. I'm also a big fan of the silent period, and this film is a prime example of what that looks like. The acting wasn't that good, the story was okay. But the cinematography and location shooting are a beautiful sight. It was a nice movie to watch, but if you can get past those flaws, it would be a great flick. Just don't expect any twists or revelations about the story. It's not like the story really came to light until the film has been in front of your eyes for so long that it feels like it. Maybe one day, it will cover all the bases. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I really don't believe there is any film that captures the feeling of being young like that. This film is basically about the relationship between the young and the older (and the first being the way we now know it is in movies to a degree), but it could just as easily be about any one of the many things and situations that make up this young adult life. The film was very beautifully written in a way of how it really could feel and should have if you're old enough to watch but not that young. The only complaint I had was that that they should make sense but there was no sense of what this did to the characters other than there was a sense that there was something there beyond just the relationship. It's a shame because the writing was fantastic and the production values could be higher but it just wasn't. The movie didn't make sense and felt like a documentary. The story was about a young couple who has it's ups and downs (I do know you can find movies or TV programs that explain that), but the concept was so fresh and it still had it's own feel. The problem that I had though was there is no point to having the main character as opposed to the kids. They just do the best they can to explain them. It is just a matter of deciding what they are and then understanding them. I would say to you that it made sense in the end.\n",

      " canoe. When the children come to the rescue, one of the pirates is killed when the men fire a cannon on them in the confusion. Later the men are sent on the journey to rescue their hero and the rest of the crew for the journey back home.<br /><br />The story is extremely well written and the animation is excellent.<br /><br />The characters are amazing--the main character is very handsome, clever, and intelligent. The boy with the big eyes and short temper is very cute compared to other male characters, and is very funny. The main characters are all wonderfully made! If my review sounds trite it simply means no one is as well as they should be in the story, which is understandable. The children, however, may not be able to appreciate the wonderful stories and adventures of the children. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A very well made and acted film. The actors are excellent and very natural. This film is one of the few films I've seen that does not attempt to be a science fiction story or a drama. It is a character study about the relationships between an average suburban girl (Karen Hucker)and her family around her father. As you would expect from the Hucker character, she is attracted to the leading man of the film, Patrick. Both the acting, the script and the directing are very well done with a believable storyline. It's a really rare thing nowadays to see real great looking performances and great direction from a director that is not attached. The ending is fitting, however, the ending is also very realistic. A definite 10 of 10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ When George Kennedy was elected U.S. president, the industry was at a fever pitch. To win the nomination, one had to go through a series of test runs as well as a series of debates. There were more than two debates, of course, but that didn't matter, since the American public wasn't interested in one or the other. It's a simple story about a young doctor and an insurance executive trying to woo a new insurance business in the name of health care. It is about the problems that can occur when people are too trusting and take for granted the government's largess. But that would only work if the two main characters were played to a crescendo by John Garfield and Frank Morgan, who are at the best times of their lives. They play well off one another. The supporting roles don't help matters either, but they can't be eliminated. <br /><br />Actors give the best performances. Garfield is at his best, as usual, and he is a real treat to look at, the film makers know he's got things to say. Morgan's character is almost always wrongfully accused, and he just doesn't know how to let it go. His line of dialogue, \"I'm sorry, that's not what you meant when you sent me your book\" is a perfect example of his total lack of control over things.<br /><br />Garrison Keillor also makes an excellent impact as a big government lobbyist, and the other supporting players help to flesh him out a little. But he's too much of a buffoon to be played to the hilt by John Garfield. Morgan is very good in this film, and that doesn't go along with the character. It almost makes him look like a villain, because Morgan is a very nice enough sort of man compared to Morgan that it's easy to understand he could tolerate this. The insurance executive is a much smaller character, but he has a good time and is very entertaining in a film that is basically going to keep him at arm's length from the audience when it has him do something extremely dangerous. The film also does have him doing something extremely dangerous, however.<br /><br />Fargo stars as the old man in charge, trying to win his life support, which just happens to be the insurance company's. He gets himself involved in a scheme to steal the insurance for the company's insurance policy. It almost works, but then it all falls apart, and with Morgan in town, the scheme is a little more complicated and has to deal with a lot bigger fish.<br /><br />The direction is good. In the moments when Garfield is at his best, he is entertaining, and the rest of the scenes are very entertaining, too. There are a number of scenes where Garfield just stands there shaking his head in the manner of someone who is not quite sure what he just did. But, as Garfield says, \"if you just go over that barrier, I won't bother. The next thing you know is going to be a miracle.\" Morgan is the epitome of the character that we like to think of as good-looking, wealthy, and good looking, but who has nothing, and doesn't know how to handle things as his life depends upon this. Hucker's character is the epitome of\n",

      " of the best shows in the US. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ i can't believe people have given this so-so a 4. The acting is good for its time, the animation at times is funky, and there's nothing out of place about this... but it's still a very weird mix of a few very strange Japanese cartoons and animation that is almost out of place. Also the graphics and sound don't compare to anyone's work on the more modern Disney or Pixar shows. I'm not sure what they were thinking but this was just very strange and out of place. It's not something I would ever recommend. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ When watching this film, I was a little shocked that the film had never been nominated or even nominated for anything at the Oscars in the past 10 years. This film is one of the greatest movies ever made. I saw it years ago and thought it was still excellent. I don't know why so few people seem to know about this wonderful film. It is not something that you would have thought it would ever really get noticed and won for. It really is a great film and is an American classic. What I didn't know was that it is such a rare gem. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If you go along to movie houses and sit around and watch people getting killed off in films this doesn't seem like an unusual movie. It's not. It's just a film and a very strange one that has a few interesting parts. The opening scene with a killer in a rubber suit is typical but not original enough to actually do much for cinema. You have a man in rubber suits sneaking around picking off his kill with the very annoying sound cue that is playing continuously throughout the movie. They are basically his killer and they kill people in rubber suits and the people they kill seem to have just never been killed.<br /><br />We are introduced to the main plot (well, maybe not original but what you will see), it involves some kind of war in some far country, there are rubber suits created by one of the soldiers, he has a fetish for wearing this rubber suit to the opera he hears there were some sort of hidden \"VCR\" in the opera where he can watch it with his naked eyes and see everything, from the inside to the outside. I don't know what the people involved in the production know but they are certainly not trying to create any kind of parody for the film. No, the main effect of the film is to show it and others. This is a great film and it is not trying to shock anyone but it is trying to make a really strange film.<br /><br />This is not a \"must see\" film, you can get it anywhere in the world with someone you like and they will enjoy this film. You can even be surprised at the weirdness of it though. You can't compare it to the surreal and surreal experiences you have just by thinking about it. This isn't trying to be funny, it isn't trying to be shocking, it's just trying to be different and weird. It is weird, so you shouldn't be shocked by this movie, but you shouldn't expect an experience you won't have though, you shouldn't expect something strange, just something you would expect.<br /><br />Now I know people that call this an \"art film.\" Is that right? It is bizarre in some ways, but there is a certain way they tried to keep you from being bored or annoyed or whatever, but it is also really \"art.\" It isn't simply a surreal, surreal film because it isn't trying to create some kind of art form. It is a strange experience, an art film. That is all you can really say about it, and that is all I can say about it. 9/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I rented this film because a friend was looking for a funny movie to watch with his friends. What he got was a serious affair of a movie, that I found funny at times, but that just did not sit right with me. I wanted to see what this movie had to offer and was really surprised. What I learned, in short, is that it cannot be called a comedy, it is a drama, even if you consider yourself a comedy expert (not yet, for most of us, anyway).<br /><br />What a shame, for my fellow American-Jews, that we cannot take the opportunity to see this new-style movie. The idea was brilliant, the characters were realistic, interesting, and, most importantly, I could watch it with the Jewish friends I have over the age of 10. (I was a 10 year-old, so I am a Jew, after all.) But the film flopped badly. I don't need my young Jewish friends to be offended that all the characters are stereotypes, but I\n",

      "-y for this film. My only complaint is the ending which is somewhat contrived. At the end, you find out there was no connection between the victim and the killer. The ending is somewhat cliché. The acting was OK. And the plot was very believable. Overall, the film is a nice surprise. It keeps the audience interested in the leads and ends up a believable ending. This film does a good job at showing the victim and the killer which makes it the better film of the three. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I'll start by saying I had very high expectations the moment I saw what the cast was and it didn't disappoint them. It is very well written and a little bit of an \"unreal\" style in its storytelling where you aren't sure who's who until they get to their very own house, but that doesn't mean the ending is off the wall. If anyone hasn't had enough of this particular character's journey, give this film a try and even better it will be the ending of \"The Family Stone\". Great Job Chris! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ As I recall the first movie, I must have just saw it after 'Wax Man' had become a hit in the United Kingdom. I remember some of the scenes where the main character's (played by the then very young Mark Gatiss) girlfriend is watching him try and act tough (and very funny). Then he just goes \"What are those buttons?...<br /><br />It turns out that the girl was actually pregnant and was also filming the movie. The film I think is in the interest of some of Mark and his ex girlfriend (now played by Kate Hughes). They were trying to get her to get out of the affair and to leave Mark. Well that is one of many twists in this one: Mark is found out was a fraud and that his ex girlfriend was in fact a spy. So the main character goes off to university to find the \"real\" Mark (played by Gatiss). <br /><br />One of Gatiss's scenes was with Mark and he is very convincing and has a very real affect on the main character - who is in love with him. But Mark gets in the way and the \"relationship\" doesn't work.<br /><br />I would have to say Mark Gatiss plays the character more like he could be and Kate Hughes does a reasonably good job playing the actress. But all in all Mark Gaven is excellent and makes the movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This one was a total disaster. The only thing worth watching here is the short, terrible, one full episode on the DVD box, which makes me wonder why they actually ran it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I just received a copy in the mail today from another video store, and was happy to learn that the picture on the video box was the same, though grainy. I don't know why this is a problem for some reviewers who rave about the DVD release, but to those of you I beg you to take a look at this film. The story doesn't ring true, though what else could I say that would make any sense at all to some viewers. I won't repeat much of the plot or give any spoilers, but I will say that it is obvious what sort of character this film is built upon. I have seen much more believable movies with much less budget, while this felt as if this movie had been put together with no other intent than to make money. I hope that if you've seen this movie that there is nothing left to the imagination. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I first saw this when i was 4 years old and i really can't describe how much i love James Blunkett's performances in this film. He is really adorable. The acting in this is very bad, but this could be due to a lack of character animation. I really love James Blunkett; i watched him many times as a kid. He is a very nice man; i always got his autograph on my books. Now as a kid, James was a very handsome lad and his family lived in the woods a bit. It was very cold and snowy the whole time so we were always watching out at the ice caves. We even saw him climb up a cliff. You know he wasn't really that handsome at all, he was a really slow moving and very boring performer. <br /><br />Anyway, in a short film version, James was a very nice young man, who made a good choice in marrying a woman who was a bit too old for him. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This film is just another example of the worst kind of 'bad horror'/'horror/sci-fi hybrid'. The story involves a girl who is stuck in a world that appears\n",

      " star. We know we're watching it on a low budget movie as he has his hands on the movie. As such no special effects, a lot of scenes with his brother going through a barn and all this talk about a \"bad guy\" and the plot... you know it was terrible but the film was just bad as hell. In fact this movie looks like it should have been an old-school American movie with action and drama and even something with a bit of romance but this could barely be called a movie. If you're expecting a B grade action movie this might not satisfy you, but then you might like the film as the story has lots of twists and turns and makes you wanna learn a lot about them but most of course only in your head. My advise is to watch and make up your own mind in this film just so you don't get to like this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ If you are looking for something that will touch your soul, this film will not do it. It lacks both of these things. It could have been an original, insightful and powerful movie. Instead, it is an awful, lifeless mess that will leave you feeling disappointed in yourself for wasting your time. I can only guess that the director (who was in production that film) had some connection with the writer or writers or something (I do not know).<br /><br />If you decide to watch this movie, be aware of the fact that you will be disappointed. Don't let the fact that it is a \"made-for-TV movie\" fool you. If you were to watch the show when it first aired on Nickelodeon, you would know that it was terrible. It has been made in Hollywood and the talent in this movie was terrible. There are plenty of things to like about this movie and it has the potential to be quite a decent movie. However, the movie suffers from a lack of story and not enough character development. In a film with character development is key to creating strong story lines. This movie has none. When the main characters are in a story line, they are merely there. So why not get story lines going with the characters? The only reason I watched this was because Jen St. John says that the show is horrible and everyone on the cast is terrible but there is little reason to watch this. The rest of the cast is mediocre and the story moves slowly so you don't get any characters. It does nothing for the character development. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ My 2 favorite actors in this movie. The guy from \"Gulliver's Travels\" and the girl from \"Ghost Train\" and you'll fall in love with these two. They are so cute together. The only problem was I saw it in the theater and really think they could have been even cut out of it! There isn't any point in making \"Bridget\" the star of this movie. I mean, a beautiful woman who plays a prostitute is not really an attractive woman at all. The only good thing about it was the guy from \"Gulliver's Travels\" but not to much. If you have seen the movie \"Gulliver's Travel\" which is pretty good but not the best movie about prostitution ever, you will like this one. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ An interesting fact about this film is that it features a very young Vincent Price - still only 17 when the film is made, but already a teenager at the time. This is most likely because at the time the script was written, Price was an immature teenager. This was the case, again, with the character played by Vincent Price.<br /><br />The story is a true story, and the acting on the part of Price and that of the other players is very good, although unfortunately very few of the films production and script is actually well done. The film has an interesting, albeit slow, pace throughout; Price and his friend/lovely band \"the Cats\" sing some catchy tunes, Price and his band run around trying to impress everyone and they get into some very very serious conflicts with real police. There are a few comedy bits (mostly in Price's case) and plenty of action scenes where the film tries to come to the fore, and even adds a few gratuitous nudity.<br /><br />There seems to be a fair amount of interest in the film - Price is very young - at least that is how the film looks - but not without some age bias. In an early scene one woman is very rude to Price and Price is trying to explain this to her. He does a lot of apologizing and tries to explain that it is all childish and childish and that he should have used his friend, not his band; but what does he mean when he talks about them as his band and you, his band of brothers.<br /><br />If you are a Price fan, you will want nothing too much to\n",

      "br /><br />I'm not trying to be a critic about the movie, I'm just pointing out that you're better off watching it. Don't waste money on renting it.<br /><br />1/Rating on my rating scale. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ this movie will have something to do with the end of time and if you're dead in a tijuana airport, your brain will be blown off and you will die. i was a teenager at the time, and it was in the same movie theater which contained the theater and everyone was there including a few of the cast and crew of the movie that was so amazing i didn't even recognize its existence! (i thought it was like a kid's movie) I've never been interested in that kind of film, but i have to admit i'm fascinated by a couple of the actors that are in it and it would be nice to see just how hard it is to do such a thing and how you react to situations that are so real. the movie starts out weird, sometimes surreal is the right word i'm thinking, then comes to a place where your consciousness is just too. in that part i thought it was well done and i don't have anything against the actors and the people that did it, but i think for those who didn't have to try really hard. i don't know if it was to much to give to the public, as i mentioned before, it is really hard to do. for me i would say i give it a 2 because it shows how, at times, people try and go through something (i haven't seen the movie yet) that it may make the movie better. i'm not gonna call this movie a masterpiece, but i think it has a lot of potential and i'm fascinated by it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It's a fine film. The actors do an excellent job, and all the story points work together.<br /><br />If you enjoy action flicks or thrillers where action is required, the storyline will make your day, while it's slow in spots, but entertaining. <br /><br />But, there are some parts in the film that fall flat for me, and they made me uncomfortable. This movie fails to capture on movie watcher, the action in it requires more and requires a more skill level to appreciate all of it.<br /><br />But I'll give it a thumbs up. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is one of the best movies of recent years to enjoy if you take into consideration the high quality of its performances. It's not a movie for the quick viewer. It holds your interest long enough to be watchable.<br /><br />In fact, there were times when I thought that it could have been a movie with a high budget, since the scenes are very detailed and the scenes of the building and the cars were very entertaining. As others have commented, the scenes in this movie were done in a very different language than I could understand. But, the movie itself provides entertainment, and it's an absolute joy to watch the movie. You want to give it a 9 out of 10. Now, I'm just looking for it on a DVD.<br /><br />And the cast does a good job: The actors do an excellent job, and the supporting cast also did a great job. <br /><br />You will probably be amazed by the story itself. It would be a very bad idea to have a movie that is about a woman who has a problem with love that is about her brother who has a problem with love, and her son who has a problem with all the love. I have yet to see a movie about love that I could say does not have a lot of love in it! <br /><br />I give this movie a 7 out of 10, a good movie for every type of film lover, the action is very intense, it's not a typical romance movie. It's about love. It's about relationships. And it's about friendship and that's about it.<br /><br />So, to my brother I say: It's not a romance movie! It's a romance movie! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a great movie that has been one of my favorites for many years, and I can't wait to see it again. Not only does it have some great lines, it also doesn't really have the usual bad jokes and scenes. It is entertaining from day one and it's always fun to laugh at the film that way. It is not a movie you will want to skip out of, but it is very hard to do at first, and one can't help but enjoy it. It is my favorite comedy in years, and I believe the same as I have the pleasure of seeing the film once. For anyone who has not seen\n",

Is this supposed to mean they are all happy together? <br /><br />Is it the case that life is such a sad one and all is well with the world and people? <br /><br />Do we need to be so mean to mean it, so as to imply that we are happy at all times and that people are happy with and through their lives?<br /><br />I just don't understand it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This was so disappointing. Just a poor adaptation (especially that one of the leads is female) of the rather interesting story of Charles Bronson. I remember liking this film on cable (or on my channel \"DVDS\" - not that one) but it would get a lot better if NBC decided to schedule it in prime time. And while there are many elements (especially in the last third of the film) that I'd rate as terrible (particularly the portrayal of the child of wealthy New York philanthropist and the way that Mr. Finch, who died very young, dies), it must be remembered that this is a low-budget film at the very end of the war, which means that it must have some of the same limitations as those that Hollywood has always regarded as the limiting factor for low budget pictures. Nevertheless, one gets a sense of the sheer brilliance of this film. I give it a 9/10 - even after the fact. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A good 80's movie. Nothing too gory but the plot line was plausible. Not all the gore/sex scenes were, like in the old days of the '70's, but they were enough for goth movies as a time filler. Plus they were good times. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie once at a small comedy festival. I didn't recognize the director but I thought it would be funny. This movie is terrible, the acting is terrible and the story has been done millions of times before. You do not care about ANYTHING and if you did you would think this is a ridiculous story line. We don't really want to have to see it again and I think it's very dangerous that people will think they were entertained. This movie seems to have been written by someone who thinks it's funny to make the point that people who believe that this is a good movie are stupid. It's not funny. There is not anything funny in this movie. We hate it and want we to not have to see it again! I strongly advise anyone who has seen this movie to do everything in their power to get their money back. This movie sucks. Go see something else. If you wanna see some blood, see blood, watch blood. There are more movies with blood in them. I would really like to see more movies that IRL that aren't from America. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ A wonderful example of how to make art - as if it were an easy job. The director uses his own life experiences as well as that of his two male roles to tell his story, to illustrate that life makes all things, and that people are made up of everything so, therefore, we are all made up.<br /><br />Of course, this would not be so much a story about real life people if it didn't focus on their lives. It could be a great film or a terrific story about real people. You want to be a filmmaker or a life coach, you want to make friends or inspire a new perspective on the meaning of life... _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie has everything...action, adventure, romance, love. It is filled with magic, magic and comedy. A very good movie. Just don't miss the ending. It is a must see for all action lovers. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I watched the original series when I was a little girl. I wasn't much of a fan of the new series. It was difficult to watch because of the age difference; I saw the original series first and then James Bond. I have always been a big fan of the new series and I have come to love the new series when I see all the old series. My favorite episode is Number 51. I must say that in my opinion it is the oldest 007 series because it was the first series I knew of that included a gun! I don't think it was because that was James Bond's favorite weapon. James Bond was an excellent spy, I thought, no matter how old he was. I think the new series is the worst, but it is true. I watch this all the time;\n",

      ", an excellent casting, terrific supporting turns from all the actors and a stunning conclusion involving the audience - all set against the backdrop of the most romantic love story ever told. There is nothing quite like this, and neither will you be any happier after seeing the movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I had never heard of the play, but I thought it interesting. I was also fascinated by the idea it presented of the people involved. I also thought it was an interesting look at the nature of love. <br /><br />The supporting players and the acting are all just wonderful. In addition, the plot is always interesting. However, I think the writing of this play was lacking and the play itself was just not very good. I think the writer would have developed this better had he/she known the play. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is the funniest sitcom that I have ever seen. The actors are amazing as well, and it is funny and funny at the same time, and for every one of the characters, is more fun. In this show, everyone is so nice, and it is great to see the families and the little things that kids know from a very young age. It reminds me of home films of my home town as well. I always enjoy watching a show that is just fun, but this show is always entertaining, and keeps you guessing every step of the way through. The writing is superb, I'm sure, and the acting is always at the very top of the game, too. I would like to think that the writing for this show is as good as what other shows in the world have to offer - the sitcom is top-notch. If you only watched one show, I highly recommend it. Even in the midst of everything that is going on, you are always thinking 'How the heck did I not know this was happening?' and that is exactly how it is. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1981)\" was a fairly decent picture, based on a novel by the writer-director of the underrated French classic, \"The Tenants\". But, it is truly an insult to the book, which is actually quite good from beginning - a very smart story-line, a good script and some good actors. Some scenes (especially those involving the \"motorcycle thieves\" is wonderful), like the one where the guy (Mr. Deyne) goes to Europe in his trailer and the scene where the guys are staying at a hotel \"with a view of the cliffs and the sea\", are just horrible.<br /><br />My Rating: 3-1/2 of a point. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I found this to be a rather dull and slow film. It was about a woman (Toten, who never got an Oscar nomination) and her husband (played by George Cukor). She's being charged to find out her fiancé's fate when she leaves her home in the city. In this version, the story has been dramatically reduced to a man attempting to get a woman to tell him something in return for his woman-love. The acting is not so much bad as it is bad. As is the cinematography, a lot of light is used, most notably the close-ups of the faces of the two \"mules.\"<br /><br />There's a plot, and the woman (Toten) falls in love with an assistant. There's plenty of plot, and the story itself is well-done, but it's not the substance that makes it outstanding, which is a shame given what was possible with the technology available to the man trying to get a woman (Cukor).<br /><br />Also, the plot as told in the film was so simple and so badly written that you rarely knew in advance the twists for the ending - or why the story might have ended up where it did. You never thought much about the woman's motivation, what was going through her mind, why was the man pursuing her all the time? Who knew? I didn't. <br /><br />So, I do have to accept that the film is a good one. I was pleasantly surprised at how good a movie it was. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. The director is always known for this. The actors and actresses (there are plenty of them) are bad actors from the production of this movie.The story (again, bad actors from the making the movie) is simply ridiculous. I know of at least one person who had written it himself. The acting is done in one take, there is literally nothing of the story that had me interested in it in the first ten minutes. It's more like they decided to have a big bang\n",

      "obsish\" characters and then you can see this is a totally different genre, with a much more realistic, realistic plot and much more attention to detail. I don't know how this was judged by some critics who claimed the movie was just another \"kung fu movie\". This is simply and thoroughly a great example of Chinese cinema where everything must be well detailed and everything is made to look realistic. This movie truly shows the world of China of the early 20th century which all movie critics always claim is boring, or the Western world of the late 40s and 50s which also was characterized by an excessive of fantasy. This movie is not as \"brief\" as some others of its time which were made to show how China in those years was completely different from our world today. It's not just the story that's fascinating. I recommend this movie, you'll probably enjoy it, even if you do understand Chinese culture!<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I didn't understand the whole plot. I thought it was set in the distant future where the main plot point was to track down the main villain, and the rest of the movie is not worth the effort. The movie was all about the main villain, who was a very evil character. Why was it made in the first place? Why was the plot so confusing? _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I watched the movie after reading the review on the TV station that showed the movie. I think this movie should have been shown in the 80's way, in the 70's way, as a movie of the year. There wasn't too much action in it but I liked how it was portrayed and how they were portraying the feelings. I had also just watched a few scenes on the show called 'The Movie' and they are even good and you should watch this too. The actors were good for a while but then the movie started to get dulled out by the boring action and to a degree I didn't even care about the characters.<br /><br />They may seem over-the-top in the beginning, but the story is told in a way that you feel the pain and the sorrow, and you're waiting to be pulled into the future, the ending is not what you expected. But all in all I liked the movie, the feelings they created in the movie is worth the watching. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I watched this film last night. It was the worst film I have seen in a long time. Not even remotely worth seeing at this late date. Forgive my french, since I speak a little english, and this is my first time watching a black comedy in French. There's no point in talking about it. I would not even describe it as a film at all since it's so boring it would be called a documentary. This movie is a waste of time. It's not even funny, the only person in the whole cast with any talent is the director. It's as though you watch an amateur movie and get a laugh out of it, and then you wait five years to get the real punch. I know I would have had a fight with the camera if this film was even out. I can not find a single laugh in the whole movie, I can't even find a single punch in it. Just one joke or two? I guess not. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Although the characters in this movie are not very good, their interactions are very well done. There are some jokes that work well and some really bad jokes, but that's to be expected. It is very funny to see two characters of similar age and intelligence that are both perfectly willing to engage in \"wisecracks\" and laugh well when given the chance and given a chance to work together. At this point in time it is obvious why this would not work in real life, but not here. <br /><br />The acting itself is very good. I found myself taking the roles of all the characters more or less on-the-spot. It is a good cast, with perhaps only one character that really looked like a \"grown up\". The rest of the cast is just normal and forgettable. Most of the characters are more of a \"we're all too old for these roles\" type and their roles are never really given a chance to really make them a good characters or even likable ones. This really doesn't work for me here, not only is it just hard to really \"get past this film\" but there are other films like this to watch, I just don't think people will watch this one time either. Maybe this is a film that would be a good way for a great cast to try out? _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I am so glad I'm not a part of the team responsible, that they actually made this movie a gem of\n",

      " a one-time-only feature for Disney's movie classic. This one's one of the great Disney sequels, but I can't think of a good review for it. I thought it was fun and original, and even the music was nice. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I must express my distaste and disbelief in all the great reviews published here. I am an avid reader of literature (Mullholland Drive, etc) and of movie genre. I am one of the many who don't appreciate a lot of Hollywood style \"reps\" for this book. I didn't feel this much about the book and its movie. Maybe that's the reason why I am so displeased; but I felt the movie was full of inaccuracies, especially in that respect. A major problem with the movie was the lack of clarity in the dialog, particularly between the young lovers, a mother and her young daughter, respectively; and also between them and their respective parents. A film like \"Nuns\" is not so much about giving you the \"feelings\" and the \"story\" of the characters, but rather \"putting them\" within the story's overall context, thus, making it \"more believable\". This does a disservice to the story of the movie - which is to me, to make it seem more \"real\". It is not that I would say the movie succeeds in this, though. It fails in just about every other respect. The dialog was very much the style of Disney's movies, and there were many gaps, as if they were not sure how to insert the dialogue and what was necessary to make the characters understandable. The movie lacked a little respect for characters as well. I was not interested in a whole bunch of characters. I think they were intended to be more than just \"love interests\", but they just all came off as \"characters\". Also, it seems like the characters all got along quite well! They just didn't seem a thing. I felt the film makers took this for very much the wrong characters, leaving for the wrong kind of love story -- where everything is \"for love\" -- in the hands of a more accomplished poet and the writer-director. You can predict what would happen. There is plenty of love story in the novel -- a family's loss of a mother, the marriage of a couple, etc -- and there is some \"inversion\" in terms of the characters at the end. I don't understand why all of this didn't make the film seem easier to understand, or why characters didn't appear more real. This is the film's biggest flaw, as you get yourself to believe all the characters had gone through the same experience -- both as lovers, and as parents. And the ending was really abrupt and not really resolved and done very well. A film like this needs some style; but, as some other comments have already said, lacks some style. This is the worst of the \"repp\" films. It just didn't take long to understand and then make sense at all. I can understand for a first time viewer that they might not get all or most of the jokes, but that's not the movie's fault. It could have been done a little better in one or more of the last scenes. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This was a wonderful movie, I love it so much. I was very impressed with the direction that David Lean was given. It was very interesting how the film and its performances of both John Hurt and Kate Winslet were created. I would recommend this film to those of you who is interested in acting in a movie. A beautiful film. Watch it and see it again. I am going to buy it soon. Well let me help you find the DVD. It's on Ebay. Go get it today before it gets out of print and I will send it in. You need to get it, you don't want this film. You want the original version. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If you like the first three \"Scary Movie\" episodes (they're really good and funny, but not as scary as any of the second three episodes), if you like the original episodes, or any movies about aliens, alien symbiotes, or the unknown future...don't bother watching this movie. But, if you like your science fiction with great original ideas, creepy characters, and great acting...get it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I will never forget Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It is definitely one of the better martial arts movies I have seen. I haven't seen it since, but it would be a good replacement. It was definitely entertaining. But, being a martial arts movie, it definitely had its share of bad dialogue and poorly acted scenes. It wasn't bad, it was just kind of...well, not good. But, on a whole other level, and this\n",

      " (which is pretty standard fare for a 90s horror movie) it's actually a decent story which is somewhat unique and interesting: It's a horror which involves a cult of followers, a doctor, and a psychic all thrown together and made up of an English actor, a Scottish actor and some kind of actress. It's actually really funny and really well done.<br /><br />It's also good to see that the movie doesn't completely suck, as most of the plot is pretty standard horror fare and they're all pretty fun and a bunch of people are trapped in a forest by some tree who talks to things through a tree stump. As soon as you hear this stump or \"Thorne\", the witch of the depths, starts talking to you, and I think it's fairly clever how she says \"Thorne, is it true?\" or \"Thorne, are it evil?\".<br /><br />I definitely recommend it... _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This was a pretty pathetic movie. I am not sure if I feel that it was a \"so-bad-it-was-good\" movie, as it sure doesn't say, and says nothing. This was a really dumb movie. I didn't even know what \"stupid\" was, what \"stupidity\", \"dumbness\" stood for. This was so bad, I just couldn't wait for it to end. I guess you would say I am a \"so-bad-it-was-my-first\" person who was watching \"The Last Airbender\" when this crap started. Please someone please save me from this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I watched this movie because I've heard a lot of good things about it. But I REALLY HATED IT!<br /><br />The script and acting were terrible, and the plot was lame. Just the acting was laughable. Plus, the ending, which is the worst ending I've seen in a long time, had something to do with the guy falling from the plane. I've seen much better acting in a play written by twelve year old girls. The end showed them running away screaming, while screaming for help. It was NOT funny, and was totally unrealistic. Also, there were some things I didn't like about the writing, including a lot of characters who seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I suppose if you want to have a movie about a bad ending, go for it. If this was written by twelve year olds in the 1980, it would have a MUCH more realistic feel to it. But hey, what do I know! I was a twelve year old in the 1980s, so I'm gonna have a go at this. And the end ruined the movie for me. The movie was BAD! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have to say that this is the sequel to a much better flick called \"The King, the Actress, and...\" which had a much smaller cast and, for the most part, more interesting story.<br /><br />It's an Italian neo-noir, set in Parma in the late 1950s, as director Alessandro Visconti is trying to resurrect what can be said about his country - a crime-ridden underworld that is ruled by crooked mobsters led by a clownish Paul Kreinitz, who wants to be a film star. The story doesn't necessarily advance there - the protagonist is a retired actress named Carla, who is looking for work in Parma's rich eastside, but her father, a criminal, doesn't approve of her taking the steps. That is, until Carla meets an old friend of hers (Mariana Giovinazzo, as a sort of floozie girl), who, unlike her father - has no criminal past. As we follow them through a series of trials, we see how Carla's character slowly evolves, as she becomes more and more involved in the cases.<br /><br />This is what makes this film so great, and so different from many other Italian films. It isn't the action and the intrigue that make \"The King, the Actress\" successful, but the story, and, above all, the ending - which is excellent. This gives us an outstanding lead - who has the character, and is more than willing to give everything in order to succeed.<br /><br />And there's some great supporting cast in this film, as well. There's Joanna Pacula, who plays the local cop, and her two minor accomplices - who are in love with Carla and the two sides can't agree on the name of a police chief. The only actors that don't play themselves are Mario Pasquali, as Paul Kreinsitz's father and Marlene Dietrich, as an aspiring actress. They've all done very well and deserve a big mention in this film.\n",

      " sure the film has a \"great\" film and there is no real emotion to it. Not that there's anything wrong in that for us who haven't seen many of such movies. In other words you won't find much. I can't think of many more appealing options.<br /><br />Overall, a real flop. In fact, I would never watch it unless you wanted to see \"The Big Trail in Italy\", if this movie comes to mind. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Well I have watched many \"Hollywood\" films over the years and never seemed to find them so boring that you just want them to end. This movie isn't one of them. The direction is great the story is fresh and original and the characters are compelling. The acting is very well done and the plot just keeps on growing. I watched it with great interest and will probably watch it again and add more before the end. I highly recommend this film to all people who enjoy movies. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ As I noted earlier the \"breathaft\" and \"crossover\" films of this film are in other words a big waste of time. For me this film felt like a cheap copy of \"Gloria\". Of course it's not the case, because it's the same thing without any real plot twists. It's all just a big mess and with the usual big names in both films the actors just don't seem like they would add anything to the film. They're either trying to look more like the characters are in \"Gloria\" or they're trying to look more like a large chain of cheap hookers. They both are. This is one of those movies where you get the impression that the creator took the original work and chewed it for breakfast. <br /><br />\"Gloria\" is a piece with a lot of promise that just wasn't worth watching. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ After a family is forced to move into the house of a mentally slow dead, a local minister is forced to find the body of the old man in his bedside manner. The corpse looks like a cross between a man who has been electrocuted and who has suffered from Alzheimer's disease and the guy from \"The Breakfast Club\". The mystery in this whole mess is that where is the dead body? The plot of the film is stupid, the dialogue is bad, the story is just stupid. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ OK now this movie is a lot more than the average horror flick. It is one of the most boring and bad movies i have put in my DVD's, but is also a real treat for a fan of movie asian movies. It has quite good acting (or so i have heard) with a good soundtrack. This movie is also a lot of fun and not completely un-watchable. The story and horror is actually pretty entertaining though. The movie is also very short but if you have a lot of free time and want to see a really sick movie than this will be the one to watch. I know it is not the movie that will make your blood boil i would say it is just a really well written and well acted movie with lots of ideas. It has enough scares, so the first one was nice but this one is a lot better. But then the movie just got worse and worse... <br /><br />This movie has all the classic horror movie tricks down pat. The acting is good it is a lot more realistic than most movie i have seen lately. The special effects are great but unfortunately not as good as most movies from today. Finally this movie keeps the genre alive by not having boring special effects like most of the Hollywood movies. The ending is very cool but the movie is a real waste of time. But to tell more i will have to go and see it again and say it is better then i could say a movie with this many good ideas. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I remember seeing this show when I was a kid. It had a fun and charming feel about it, and I even remember the \"cute\" cat story. I was very young, and had no idea about this show, and all I knew was that it has the quality of a top-rated HGTV special. The cat story was very good, especially with the great dialogue, and wonderful story. It was also wonderful to watch a well acted, well written show with fun and funny bits. It was always a good day to visit the mountains. This show was just awesome, but so is any shows like it. I loved it!! I have seen my share, and have always wondered what was the show like in the 1980's? Now that I am older, I wonder what it was like to be a kid again.

      " he really wanted to see, it was one of the most excruciating, exhausting attempts of all, and I have to admit that I've been a big \"F\" fan ever since I first saw the film in theaters.<br /><br />I saw it again one time in a movie theater and I've never really laughed so hard since.<br /><br />This film has a good idea, but it's also very boring, and I can't stand even a slightly amusing film. That said, it remains a very enjoyable film to watch. When I'd seen it in theaters, I wasn't laughing so hard that I was crying. But, at the theater I have always found it quite funny, especially when it dealt with the issues that are being dealt with in that particular part of the film.<br /><br />I also have to wonder why people are making a documentary about a man dressed as a spider, while they still are. Perhaps, it's all the rage! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ My God! This movie blows!!! This movie has so many things to it. First of all, is the writing and direction that is so good, I'm just amazed that a movie like this is not good in many countries, both in Japan and everywhere else. It's so good, you just cant believe its good in the world. There are so many great actors in this movie. There are so many very strong, funny, strong characters in it. The one that sticks out in my mind is Hikaru, because he is so good at comedy, which I am not so good at, but he is. The main character, the protagonist, is a person who doesn't take himself too seriously. Very well done, I would highly recommend it to everyone. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This one's pretty stupid. I didn't like the original, but it was actually a pretty decent flick. I've always thought it was because they just didn't make anyone who wasn't a girl, like the original was a guy. However, there was a character named \"The Boss\", who was a woman with a very thin, thin layer of skin, and he got everything from the Boss, she didn't get anything from him. I didn't enjoy this one, and I haven't wanted it to end again in any way. I wish they had made more of these. I wouldn't give it a 1, but it's a 1 if you ask me. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This was an amazingly interesting project. The cast was amazing. It definitely is a movie that I'll be looking for. But one thing that I've noticed is that most of the actors that I know are not the usual pretty boy types, and the movie was interesting enough to watch for them. If they had just given the script to an actor, like John Cusack or Turturro, and made him the lead of the movie I think it would have been more of a great movie. A movie you can sit through, because some of the things about the movie don't seem to go well with each other. At times it is so weird, it is hard to watch at times. I really believe the movie is an extremely well done movie, but if you are easily amused by anything, you should not see it. This is another good movie, not just because of the cast. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie was terrible. I was so bored. It doesn't get worse. They even say \"The good doctor\". They even made fun of Dr. Caine's death and some of the medical stuff he'd say. They even played the part. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film is so horrible, I can't believe they put it on the box. I hate movies with a bad script, even worse actors and some with terrible writing. It is a comedy if there ever was one. I can't believe someone actually financed this. I can't believe they actually knew the contents of the message they were sending out. If you haven't seen this movie, don't. If you love movies like this, don't waste your time. I gave it a 1 out of 10 because you will want to see how bad the worst actor in the cast can be if he goes out and does that one night in a bar and makes fun of his own movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I watched the trailer for this movie and saw only an image of a very interesting and interesting music video. Then I watched it, because I thought it looked really interesting and I also have to admit, a few years ago. It does look good enough but in the end I thought it was really a terrible movie, not for a young audience who haven't seen most of the very known and good horror films! The movie has a\n",

      " happy sense of being \"together\" with this great team. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ There's nothing to say. The acting was over the top, the effects were laughable, so to speak. I'm actually surprised that anyone liked this film. The film just left you wondering what happened. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ As a film history buff, I loved the first \"The Kid\" and, yes, my heart belongs to this film. For one thing, it has none of the \"cheap humor\" that the first film lacks. In other movies, the characters' behavior is so over-the-top, so un-charismatic that it's not even funny, much less affecting the audience. \"The Kid\" isn't even that great of a film. It has nothing of substance; it's just a silly adventure story with the perfect amount of cheap \"gag,\" silly antics, and slapstick. What it lacks is charm. If Michael Jackson was in this film, it would be a case of \"I'd rather have no Michael Jackson's hair than the hair of Michael Jackson.\" It's not the humor that's the problem. It has humor that is cheap, unromantic, and not very engaging. Michael Jackson makes a decent cameo as the thief who saves the day. But Michael Jackson? He was pretty cheap and wasted in this. No wonder they never made a Michael Jackson album. And that movie had more songs than this. So what's the point? And where did this movie go wrong? I guess this film is a bad example of how not to adapt a film script. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ My first and probably most important lesson from \"The Bothersome Man\" is a great film to avoid, and my second and third most important lesson is: Don't watch this film! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"Alfred Hitchcock invented his own genre, the suspense film,\" says director Ralph Richardson in a recent interview. \"It's a trap for all types of roles. A woman is murdered; her husband is on the run, his daughter is getting married and is in a compromising situation, the ex-wife is in the house of an unscrupulous realty man and he wants her. And there are these very complex plots to go with the murder. The suspenseful parts in the film don't come out and they are hidden behind a plot rather than being used in a logical way to set up the story.\"<br /><br />The suspense is generated by the many tiny coincidences that all lead up to it. The husband is murdered in a jealous rage at the daughter, the wife in a car accident and the house being used as a hot-air balloon (this is an ironic remark about a film that comes out of the house of a man who wants his wife killed). The murderer's daughter is called and, as she's called in a joke, tells him that her father is at the house. The wife calls and tells her something about going to her husband's wedding and finds out that his wife's father is her fiance's husband. The husband doesn't believe her so she gives him his business card, the picture with his wife, the wedding picture and the number of his fiance. Then he walks her to the door where his wife's body is left in his daughter's kitchen and her husband is murdered. She finds out in a way but the murderer, his daughter, and the husband all know that she is not telling the truth! So now they realize that that's a very good plot.<br /><br />\"Alfred Hitchcock invented his own genre, the suspense film,\" he continues. \"The suspense elements in the film are not the main attraction in the film, but rather, the story is built up in the smallest way possible to get you to believe that it is the murder of the husband that is the centre of the story, and therefore the film belongs to that genre.\"<br /><br />The film is one of the best examples of how \"a mystery about a husband and daughter in a small Pennsylvania village with no big secret\" can be made into a thriller. Richardson is a film legend but in my opinion he has only one thing on other filmmakers to emulate, if they want a film made in his style: a Hitchcockian script. But in a way, he should have been directed by Hitchcock. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a wonderful movie from Japan, that makes us feel like we can learn something from the old Japanese masters. The story is wonderful and the cast are great, but the ending will probably disappoint many.<br /><br />However the movie is still very effective for me, it reminds me of old Japanese movies, the story and acting are superb, I especially admire the role of the boy and his relationship with his father, especially his relationship\n",

      " Hermans was quite a coup, as I thought so far out. And I was in a bit of shock at the success of this film. \"My Fair Lady\" is one of the great classics of the 20th century. Not only was it one of the biggest ever films, but of the year; and while the original movie is more famous for it's musical numbers, and the film itself is well-known for its comic-strip inspired sequence, \"My Fair Lady\" was just as funny as all hell, and just as brilliant, because it took a number of different approaches to tell it's story. This was one of the biggest musical films ever, and this story is so well known that it's very easy to see why. If you liked \"Les Miserables\", which was also a musical, if you're interested, it's one of the few films you can really enjoy. I'm sure it'll make you smile a bit, but its not a film that you'll forget in a hurry. \"My Fair Lady\" is a must-see, and I strongly recommend it to anyone. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A perfect combination of classic comedy, great comedy (of a high standard) with a story about love, and all the things that are best described as \"drama\". The story is the best I've seen (I've seen a lot of Hollywood films) in a long while, and you can also feel the love and emotion of the couple that is the love interest of the main character, and also the disappointment of the old man (in the very first scene) that had always wanted to get married, but had had no luck, so the director did his best to remind the viewer that things would really come together in the end. <br /><br />The movie had many other funny and/or sweet scenes. If you're not a fan of Hollywood comedies and comedies in general, this movie will still bring something to the viewers. If the viewer is a new viewer, it might seem strange, but it's not. But that's also the reason why the viewers like it: because it's a good, simple, funny movie that also shows you that good acting has sometimes a lot to do with making a good movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw Dark Harbor as part of a special Halloween presentation of all movies released on TCM in the 1980's-1990's including both the classics(Snoqual,Blackfish) and the more recent classics(The Blue Lagoon,Citizen Kane,Gone With the Wind,Jackie Brown,Scarface,Avenger,Red Rock West) but this is a movie that does not compare to these two titles except for the fact that it has a couple of funny lines such as \"I've never been good at taking a good laugh\". That has to be one of the funniest lines ever! I saw this movie many years ago but it has never failed to bring me back! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Well, the people at IMDb, have just ranked it right up there with the two great, and much beloved TV sitcoms of the Eighties. Now I can understand why a lot of people love this movie - if I've ever seen it for real. All of them. In fact, I saw it several years ago, but I didn't think that it was funny then. Now, I love the movie so much that I'd recommend it to anyone, and recommend it to my 8-year old child, who's all about \"the whole family in love for one another\" - to every family film, to every family and family movie.<br /><br />There is also plenty of good and amusing moments in this movie. The character's are all real, almost caricatures of actors of the era. The humor is fresh, very well-natured, the dialog is very funny - and there are some very amusing musical themes and fun performances - especially from the beautiful Katey Sagal as the mother of the movie. She's all right - cute, lovable...very young, athletic and with a sweet, innocent, innocent look to her. But you know what else? She is a very funny actress.<br /><br />All in all, I absolutely love this classic, and recommend it to anyone and anyone. It's just right. If you haven't seen it, rent it now. You'll definitely love it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Yes, I got this movie by accident, and am just thankful. I had never heard of it before, maybe from the ads. It is a very smart, thought-provoking exploration of the dark history of the LAPD in the period before and after Bloody Weekend, which was not well-known in Los Angeles and other cities back in the day. So I can hardly say that this film was not\n",

      "? But this is only the first one.<br /><br />The movie is about a bunch of girls who come in contact with a strange man (played by a great John C. Holmes cast). The film doesn't end with the girl's arrival at the \"family\" (home) of the man and one of the girls. In the next scene, we see that the man is back again at the home. But he apparently has left this time because the woman doesn't recognize him. He comes back in an attempt to reconnect with his family. The family sees him as a monster because he's always around. And there are a slew of twists here that make this film a great bit of sleaze porn. John C. Holmes brings the monster into the open again and he doesn't hurt anyone. The woman even takes her clothes off and makes a run for it. But the other gang members come in and try to help her. The girl has an unkind and jealous husband and brother and he tries to kill them all off because he is a \"monster\". He even tries to kill his mom because she made him run to the basement where his clothes are. All these forces come together to make a horrible movie for John C. Holmes and the sleaze-porn-loving audience. But hey we'll all be happy that there were no dead people in this film! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I found this movie to be extremely slow, un-emotional with a fairly predictable story line, and it is very predictable. The acting was okay and I don't mind a small, slow paced role, it is still bad. The plot was extremely thin and there seemed to be many plot holes. I did find it funny how every time there was a scene a line of dialog about exactly what happened, even if there were scenes missing.<br /><br />The music sounded strange and just really did nothing at all to get me interested in the film. The whole movie seems to be a comedy or comedy with no real dramatic value. I really couldn't connect much with the plot or if I should say more. The movie seemed to drag the whole time out for nothing other than comedic value. If there was truly no dramatic value or even just was a comedy I would have rather watched it than to see the movie and then went to bed. The movie itself isn't all that interesting and it wasn't one that I would recommend. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I really wanted to like this film. It looked beautiful and it had a very simple story. But I just couldn't watch all the way through. It seemed to go on for about an hour and a half, and the rest seemed inane. Why did no one at the school seem to know this girl's real age? Who the hell would be that old to be dating a girl who is so crazy? And what is the mother/drifter guy doing? Is this supposed to be a comedy? Or just a weird drama? Or just just a bad piece of drama? It seems to almost be the former. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It was amazing. I am a huge fan of the old school. I think all of the actors gave wonderful performances. Every actor that has played in the old school has done a wonderful job. There are a lot of people who say the show is boring, with over the top behavior from the character. I think it's wonderful that they changed that with the writers, and gave the character a strong presence so that we understand and care about her, just like we would anyone else. It is a great show and worth a visit to watch. I hope everyone can watch. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was looking for something of a \"straight to video\" kind of rating and the only reason I saw this movie was when a friend mentioned it on a local station. So I have some sympathy for the \"actor with no acting experience\" when it comes to his \"first movie\" effort...the film is \"straight to video\" because the producer paid for a good lot of the equipment and the actors seem interested in the film, so maybe the filmmakers didn't invest a lot of money in their film in general and for \"The Cat in the Hat\" production. At first, they seem to have wanted to make a thriller with an \"out of the box\" quality, just like they hoped to make a drama with an \"out of the mind\"...I don't mean to knock them off the hook, but the films seemed to lack drama either. Perhaps the only reason I didn't rate this a one is because not everything in a \"straight to video\" release is \"out of the body\" is out of sight for a viewer, like that beautiful old video of an old actress who has lost it or something.<br /><br />The film seemed to be made purely to fill a time slot and\n",

      " no. As far as romance in his show, I wouldn't blame him. There's no chemistry in the rest of the cast except for Lala. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ For this, there are no comparisons... this is a B1-level B-series B-rated R-rated actioner.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of slapstick comedy shows or action shows... maybe I was a little spoiled by \"Dynasty\", but I think it's time to give them a chance. In \"Dynasty\", slapstick humor was at the top...<br /><br />In this show the jokes are painfully boring and almost never lead anywhere. The lead characters have no real depth and are also horribly caricatured.<br /><br />There are so many characters but I don't ever get to them. Sure, some of the people in this show are good guys... but most of them are just dull stereotypes. There's an awful lot of empty space around them.<br /><br />At points, the slapstick humor is so dull and lame that it's even painful. I mean, at times it was funny.<br /><br />As a \"good\" action movie or not, I was sorely disappointed with this show. Even Berenice Bejo wasn't worth the watch, but there is hope for \"Rambo in the White House\"... in the late '80's.<br /><br />And there were some redeeming effects... the show had an almost cartoon quality to some parts.<br /><br />If this show isn't on cable, I'll find something else to do. For example, if a friend or family member is doing an appearance of this show on TV, I hope he can remember watching it (or some remote source will do).<br /><br />Bottom line... \"Dynasty\" is not worth your time. At least not if you really want something original.<br /><br />If you must watch this, run away from it and stick with some of your friends... that's the ONLY smart thing you can do. You won't be disappointed. If you decide to watch \"Dynasty\" please stick with some of the movie... not the show... watch \"American Ninja\".<br /><br />And if you want to watch some good, genuine slapstick comedy, go ahead... just avoid this show like rabid dog poop... _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I remember it in 1982, and it's still good. Even a bad movie can be very cute in childhood. It's a sweet story, good plot idea, and a great, fun time. It's just plain fun to watch, from start to end. Even on its own, there are a few scenes that really remind me of my elementary school. Even back then I was a little embarrassed to look in the DVD player, but I don't think that even the best DVD players ever would have allowed me to do that to a movie. Anyway, enjoy these little jokes and laugh hard. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ One of the things that is fun about this movie is that the film never seems to have an interesting plot, it just flows forward with a great deal of randomness.<br /><br />I never get the impression of a movie that is going to suck one bit after another. I just never seem to be in the mood for it. However, sometimes, I do start to get annoyed at the ridiculous acting and/or the ridiculous lines that the lead character spouts.<br /><br />What is always odd is how the people are supposed to be British. Well, the British make the jokes. The Irish laugh hard. They are also funny sometimes. As the people say the Americans are always funny to me.<br /><br />What is sometimes odd about this movie is that I thought the lead actors were probably the only people in it.<br /><br />But I was wrong. There is not one person that comes across as a person, a person actor, or a lead. They all seem to have just a few lines and not really the best way to start speaking.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good movie, wait until it is released to try it. There is nothing more entertaining than this. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie reminded me of a good British \"Columbo\" episode that made about 20 US bucks. The storyline revolved around a family of thieves and their attempts to steal money from their house and their father's (James Mason) death. The movie was so far fetched that I could only assume it was made up as the movie went on. It also reminded me of the way they usually make movies about the world and some people in it, the rest\n",

      " me, you have to forgive the movie that it is called \"Candyman\" and some of the characters. I don't want you to think Candyman is a bad movie or that it is stupid. If anything, it is an old-fashioned and a wonderful story. The only time the movie starts to get boring and stupid is when the Candyman meets the old man, and the movie has a sentimental sound. That is the only good part of the movie. I mean who would want children like that at that age. But if I saw \"Candyman\", I would laugh at it and say, maybe they are better than I thought them. But that's all. One of the best movies that I have seen in the last decade. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I know it's been a few years since I first saw this movie and I still remember it, but it still doesn't make me want to watch it again. \"Scarecrows\" was probably the best film version of E.T. I love all the films and TV shows that have been influenced by this original concept, but \"Scarecrows\" was certainly not one. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This was a good movie. It is based on a really cool book. The special effects were excellent and were way better than most films today. It is a movie that I would watch often. It has the typical low-budget production values and great writing. The only thing that is really disappointing about this movie is that it was not released in the theaters yet. Now when it is out on DVD watch it and be impressed. I was so thrilled to see that the author, Jeff, was involved in the project. Jeff was in the process of producing a screenplay when this movie was finished with his son, so he has done a great job writing this adaptation. There are really no other movies like this out there. I think everyone should watch this movie and get inspired and give their kids a chance to see it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If you're in the mood for a good movie about a very famous celebrity, you can at least enjoy this one. The film is a great laugh, a heart-attack, a climax, everything. There's probably no movie that comes close to the quality of this one. Some famous actors, especially in its musical setting will get on your nerves, but this is a classic that everyone can enjoy. The only thing that really stands out to me is the music: they're all very good, and you don't need extra props for them. It just works for this movie. A perfect picture of a great celebrity; a great movie to watch a few times! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie in the section of the DVD rental store where I normally shop. At the same time, I also found the quality of the DVD slightly surprising. It was an unexpected treat.<br /><br />The DVD, while being shot in very dark scenes can not help, but it helps the film with the intensity of the events portrayed. I have a very high tolerance for dark scenes, and I have always appreciated movies that allow you to understand the characters more without the dark scenes. This movie did just that, and it did it with a very compelling and entertaining manner that left me wanting more.<br /><br />The first half of the film is a little slow, but I was hooked right from the start. I'm a big fan of the film and it is definitely worth your time. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In my opinion, The Three Stooges were the best comedy trio ever made, if not the best. They are all good, but are in their own unique way to describe themselves. Their style was a bit different from their fellow actors, but their humor still resonated with the characters they played. Even if they did not do for comedic movies what Laugh-In did for Hollywood, The Stooges still had something worth doing for the people that were watching them at the theater. Although the Stooges were not a very serious bunch of comedians, by comparison with their fellow actors they would almost become a comedy parrot. If you enjoyed The Three Stooges, do yourself a favor and start watching their TV specials, or even better, their movie versions. Some great comedy from the Stooges. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I remember this show when I was about 5 years old. I liked the gags and the special effects. I even liked the voices. My brother said that he would change his name to 'The Wolfman.' I remember at the time, I thought he was calling me 'the Wolfman.' But, it still feels like hours and hours after watching 'The Wolfman' and 'The Simpsons' that I still think\n",

      " no longer exist, this film is a reminder of his genius. I was fortunate enough to see the last of the films of Tarkovsky (and of him's) on a recent summer Saturday night of spectacular and beautiful color. It was truly worth it! <br /><br />In a way, \"Rigsa\" is probably the only film of Tarkovsky's that I ever did not want to get my own copy of and have not seen, although I know people who did make the mistake of that would do so. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This film was just as good if not better than The Usual Suspects (1997). Yes, it does borrow some elements of The Usual Suspects, but unlike the Usual Suspects, has its own way of showing the movie, as well as its own style. The acting is great, especially from the lead couple. The music is a perfect vehicle to show the story through the eyes of the characters, as well as how they behave, so we don't have to feel guilty about what happens and why. When you see the whole movie and feel the entire direction and feel is good, you can leave with a sense of joy as well. The ending is also good, and has a feeling of closure that I'm sure you all feel. A true gem, and one that I highly recommend. 9 out of 10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The only thing i'm going to say about this movie is to keep your head in the game and think about what's going around you. It's been over 2 years since I last saw this in the cinema, and believe me it's been a while! When watching it now, i am really thankful for that, seeing that most of the acting is as good as it was before i made the movie, and the dialogue is the best i've seen in a while.<br /><br />I've been a fan of the band's work for quite some time now, for some reason. Recently, they started playing a couple of their live concert videos on youtube. I think for me it's been the best video part of the whole movie, and i think the rest of it is a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />The only problem, is that the movie is in Danish. You've got to watch it for it to appear in the list. Not that it really matters, but i have no idea what the hell they're doing that? _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The movie was well scripted and acted. The production values are well done, a testament to its budget.<br /><br />One can't help being touched by the story. It touched me and everyone I knew, a true charm, a pleasure to hear some who know the movie.<br /><br />The ending, the last part of the film, was particularly sweet. I hope that a soundtrack is released later in its time period. I wish it would be as good as this. Hopefully, they will release a larger audio track. <br /><br />I'm sure most people will have to admit that the plot is a little corny. But the story and execution really set this apart from similar films.<br /><br />If anybody knows where I can acquire a digital download of this music, I would consider purchasing it. I am certainly curious to see the full-length, which is not currently available.<br /><br />Hopefully, this comment can clear up any doubts I may have had about this movie. The acting was fantastic, the sets beautifully decorated, the special effects were top-rate.<br /><br />A very worthwhile film. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a movie that could have been an interesting film if it had not been made into a garbage piece of garbage by a bunch of \"indie\" media companies as an advertisement for their next piece of \"indie\" crap. <br /><br />The acting in this film is worse than in High School Musical; the \"twists\" are predictable, the \"plot\" makes no sense, and the \"special effects\" were terrible. <br /><br />It's sad really, since it's very rare to see a good film produced since 1980 about this level of filmmaking. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ What you want to know about this movie is that it's not an insult. It doesn't have the worst soundtrack ever put to a Hollywood movie, nor the worst acting ever to grace the silver screen. The film makes a mockery of the usual Hollywood formula by turning the typical genre conventions on their heads. For once it does NOT use the \"best guy/girl\" or girl/boy roles. The character as is is drawn completely from the comic book characters you know and love. When he's not playing a gay (or bisexual)\n",

      " to get out of that horrible body.<br /><br />The acting was OK, but the story-line had too much in it to sell this film, it's all about some girl and the creepy killer and the girl's father being the main focus of his evil plot.<br /><br />Overall: this film looks like you could make a great thriller with a couple of friends and a few beers, but only you would want to use this as a \"hunch\". The plot was too complicated for my liking and was not that much made sense. This film made no sense, at all. I thought it may be good on TV, but it would have to be more suspenseful to scare you than it was. I have to say, this is one that I would wish my girlfriend never watched. It's not even the same on a good night of watching her.<br /><br />I give it a 4/10. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I found this film to be one of the best I have seen this year, and i think its one of the best that i have ever seen in my life as a part of the year, it has great acting, great set, and good story. I find it hard to describe this film to all the people who have seen it, you just know this film is one of the best that you will watch in 2017. The story is awesome, and i find it hard to believe that this film ever reached the top 1000. I saw it at a film festival, and i heard that it was going to be a huge success, but i would hope that it would do very well at 100, in my opinion it should also play in London at some time so that it is not forgotten about by people in places. All of this is because of the very talented actor who acted in this film i hope you have a amazing year! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Wow! Wow Wow! Wow! Wow! This little gem truly amazed me: it's so true. I'd never heard of these people, but I was already a bit curious. I really didn't know what to expect, but all of the actors did a sterling job, and I felt all the emotions that all of us have at one time or another in our lives. This movie, about a young African-American who gets a scholarship to visit France because of her beauty, shocked me. I wasn't sure when this movie would end. It seemed to drag on a little, maybe just a little, but all in all it was wonderful. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ One of my favorite movies with lots of memorable lines, great music, good acting, and a well told (not always) story about a mother trying to stay in front of her children but is trapped in a marriage that isn't what she thought it would be. I was very much looking forward to the movie. It seems that there were so many things wrong with the movie, but I think everything made sense. The movie made great sense, I loved it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ To sum it up: The storyline is very weak and the movie is very slow and unfunny. There is not much in the beginning that makes you even think about the situation. And, you must have a lot of drugs. In the next scene he is being a hero, and you begin to root for him to succeed. Well, guess what? It happens. And the way the movie ends is probably the worst I have seen. The acting was very poor too (although it was better than some of the other actors). The main thing that made this movie is that it made you think of its \"sadness\". It's like a bad bad dream. And then, when these \"dreams\" are coming true.. it's just...well...weird. Overall, a waste of time.. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ My girlfriend loved this movie, and asked me to re-write the plot for her. I am writing this on the advice of the same author, as I have read this story and thought about it every day for the past six months. The film quality was very good (not as good as a low budget western, but above that), and so I added two points to the rating: the \"jungle\" fight was very, very good! I've seen other movies that are much better, but most other movies don't have a high fight to earn the title \"jungle.\" If any film had a good fight to earn a rating of 10, this movie would have it. In fact, the jungle fight was a lot of fun seeing. The actors played their roles perfectly, and when not acting, they also did a great job. The plot was very good, and the film had some great action scenes and suspense. I enjoyed this film. This\n",

How could it have been any bad? Who the heck wrote this? Why does every film of this ilk have someone who makes as much as the guy who did \"Titanic\"? I can't stand this \"movie\" and I'm not the kind that likes to watch movies that take itself seriously, and this was no exception. It's a boring, predictable, unfunny, pretentious movie with very little reason to even be entertaining. Just watch it and be amazed, because this can be something! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I think this is a must see. It is really funny. I just see someone with this stupid movie. If you know anything about america or anything else, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!! you will get a headache. The cast of \"comedians\" is good and the jokes are great. \"The best\" is one scene that is to funny. It is a very funny movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie has many different ideas and many different parts. And what I liked about the movie is that many parts are just so amusing! Not every movie can be good, but I do not see why it is not! Just some things that I liked: 1. The director and the cast were really funny! The music and the film are nice at times! 2. That the director didn't take himself too seriously! He made so many funny stuff! 3. The scene when the girls were leaving the club, the way it was filmed was really funny. I especially liked the way that the guy with the guitar was \"playing\" it! And it was hilarious!<br /><br />4. You really do not see that much in a week anymore, I mean it is so funny how that guy is always in the air (as you see him do it!) and there are so many funny things happening in it! 5. Overall I think this movie is good! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ OK, here's a little film for you kids but I'm talking about the best thing about it. \"The Princess Bride\" is the best show of all-time. And it's one of the best show-movies for sure. And I have watched many and many episodes of it. In this movie, I liked it a lot. It's not about what the plot is like the show, it's about everything. This is a very fun to watch, to laugh at, and to see a lot of funny moments too. There are so many ones in the movies: 1) The little dog is great! 2) The little guy is beautiful (he is a dog)! 3) The big guy is awesome!! 4) The lady (Dwight Tatum) is super cute and her performance is hilarious! 5) The horse who is so cute and loves to play games and talk to his owner (Barryman, William S. Barber, and the big guy) and also has great skills!! 6) The Princess Bride-characters are so adorable and they are the ones that do a lot of the funny things in the movie, so if you are a big fan of the show, you need to have seen this movie as the best TV TV show of all-time!!! (In my opinion, it's the best show, the best comedy TV-series, the best love-stories, and the best Disney series-programs, so you can't compare it with Disney's \"ThighWorld\".) Don't be fooled by some of the rubbish written on this review: the whole thing is the best, original, original thing, and it's probably a lot in such a limited time. It is my favorite thing, and very funny, too. And there is an aria, especially at the end! And all the characters ARE very funny!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I like these B-movies, just like you like \"Wetback\" or \"Stonetown.\" And while some like them, others don't. And \"Wetback\" is not as good as \"Stonetown\" in terms of entertainment value, but I like it a lot, because it is entertaining.<br /><br />\"A Big Big Blow\" is a remake of the 1935 movie that starred Don Fowler, and was a huge hit with adults. It was a remake of a 1926 film that had John Gielgud play a character with the same name, and was a very entertaining movie at that, with a nice cast to go along with it.<br /><br />I like this movie.

      "! And the film is a masterpiece. The script, the acting, especially the acting of the two young boys is outstanding. And there is a very great scene when the father tells the little boy his story. I saw this in theaters in 1977. When I saw it on DVD with a special feature, I was not satisfied. There were too many scenes that I missed when I found out what was happening. But even those scenes are on the DVD. It is in the movie. There are some other minor extras. I can't watch this without listening to the soundtrack. I will give you a hint. When we are talking about some of the children's songs, you can hear the kids' voices. I am not a big fan of those particular youngsters but they really did a fabulous job of capturing the spirit of the children's stories. In addition to the lyrics by the children's entertainers, there are some great lyric readings, some dramatic readings, music, and of course, the films. So if you like movies about young children, this is for you. If you do not find this special, you may want to check out the special features. If you love movies about young children, this is for you. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Although there is much to complain about in this movie, I will not do that, because most of it is in itself funny. If you like to complain about something, then this is for you. I'm glad that I saw this movie in theaters, because in most movies of this type (think \"The Room,\" \"The Simpsons,\" \"The Wedding Planner,\" etc.) it would take about 2 years to reach a certain level of success (or, in other words, I wouldn't even notice it during the first month). It is, as the DVD cover says, \"Just another \"Mildmannered,\" an early-90s TV movie from the TV company Grey Television, the same one that came out before \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Movie.\" <br /><br />In that era (the late 90s and into the first decade of the second decade of the 2000s), Grey Television's was the most powerful (meaning, television in America, period), comedy company in America, with the shows such as \"The Daily Show,\" \"The Steve Holmes Show,\" \"The Daily Variety Show,\" and \"The Movie Company Playhouse\" in the same era.<br /><br />The Grey Television movies, from the mid to late 90s, were all classic TV movies, so much so, that many of them were re-mastered in 2000 (I haven't seen a lot of them, though, because when I saw them, I was watching them over two hours, sometimes one or two minutes behind, depending on how much I missed). But they were still a comedy, to me. If you saw them as late 90s or early 2001 movies, then you would see the same humor as I did.<br /><br />In the late 90s, there was so much of this funny stuff going on in TV and how we lived our lives, and the commercials and \"so what?\" in commercials, that you thought (again, this probably just me being so particular), \"Hey, maybe I never laugh like this again.\" The Grey Television movies were the first movies (and the TV commercials) that the company (Grey Television) dared to do with its motto of using the TV to the maximum, even in sitcoms. They really were something else. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It has become something of a common complaint in recent years that movies which are generally considered by the public to be a great tragedy are usually also generally made to be laugh-out-loud great comedies by the same \"professional\" production team. It was only a year later (in 2002) that I had a chance to see the movie, with my own two eyes( I'd seen it the week before, not sure if it was the same one).<br /><br />The movie does contain some very serious and disturbing material, including child abductions, a wife beating her husband, incest/pregnancy, suicide and a murder he commits while on the job, but as a drama the movie may actually really hold up. The problem is that if you take it apart for what it is, it's pretty much a simple enough tale. A woman who has no business being a nurse is lured into a \"reunimagined\" hospital by the hospital's proprietor, who offers her a job (the story never really explains exactly what he/she does there; how long the job will last, who will be the patient, what's the specialty) and it's the patient of the town \"witch\" that gets killed in a strange way. This is in a sense a very straightforward, straight-forward movie, as it was made by people with brains who could be bothered to put their theories on film.\n",

      " rat. Then a great sequence involving a woman looking like a panda and a man with a bat. This film is a must-see and anyone who hasn't seen this film is absolutely insane.<br /><br />You have the director of a fantastic film called THE ROAD TO ROMANCE. Here is an insight into his masterpiece. \"The ROAD - \" is the best of his films (if not the best) and his most recent feature THE RIVERSIDE, is also a masterpiece.<br /><br />THE RIVER OF PERFECT CIVILIANISM is a MUST-SEE for EVERYMAN.<br /><br />RATING: ********** _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ For me the worst mistake I could make would be to take a crack at this movie. I have an inclination that I had a couple of hours to kill and I probably would have fallen asleep if you had not been there to help me. And that, I am sure, is a very good reason for not doing this movie. As for the rest of my comments, the acting was okay, but I am pretty amazed that David \"The Sword\" Reynolds is still alive with his jaw still wired, and that Mike Connour's \"Saviour\" is still wandering on to fight in the Congo. In that case the role of the African-American Saves the Day soldier is a pretty important one. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I just read the comment and I have to say I was extremely impressed. I was a little interested in checking it out because I was intrigued by Sean Bean's last appearance in the same film that year. He played the part of David Holm and it's a small part but still a great role. Sean Bean has shown that he can still draw the line when it comes to acting. He has also shown that he can get into great detail in very subtle acting with almost no dialogue. However, to really understand his character he always needs to know where he is, who are his enemies and what do they want to do to him in the end. In such a way Sean Bean's character is a very complex character and not just in the storyline, but also the characters in the story. The scenes in which he has to travel to find his mother and his father or to find a way out of difficulties, are very real. One scene makes you think about the way the characters think about what they will do about the events until they find the right plan for the situation and then the way the characters deal with the situation. They are like one another, always trying to figure out the best line of dialogue to tell each other but then it is up to Sean Bean to make the right choice. The only disappointment is that the ending doesn't actually do justice to Sean Bean's performance. It leaves a lot to like his character and what we didn't get in the first film. What was Sean Bean's relationship with his father? Does one? The way he met his daughter and then the way things end doesn't make much sense and leaves a lot to be desired. But the story is of course worth the try.<br /><br />P.S . I also saw the 2007 picture and I think it is worth the look.<br /><br />Thanks Sean Bean. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ As a small film, this game is good fun. The graphics of the best gaming games are just as good and the characters you like and hate are more than just one of them. This game is an interesting mix of games you dislike from some kind of perspective and fun games you love. Like with many games you can tell most of the game elements are coming from previous games, the graphics are good, the humor is there and the story is fun, which makes this game fun for a group of gamers (especially those who is has played games together playing the same character or a character they know). Like so many other films, it tells you how to progress your characters, the types of things you can do on your ships and you can also tell which types of things you can do on your ships. It tells you how your ships can get attacks from the enemy fleet and it helps to learn certain ship skills (i.e. how to set fire to an enemy ship). The fun in the game is in the gameplay, rather like in real life, with lots of events that occur and you have to learn about them.<br /><br />My favorite game elements are the level design. I don't wanna go into detail of level design, since the game itself is pretty complex and detailed, I've seen other good game levels in another review so I'm not going to go into those parts in depth, but I believe most of the level design in this game is influenced by earlier level design in the first Star Trek computer game the game does have many hidden levels. The level layouts look real good, with good props and\n",

      " fine, it also features a lot of fantastic special effects and gorgeous photography. And the voice over is hilarious.<br /><br />\"I will give you this. You will understand, when you are free.\" This movie is a funny, witty, well-written film and it should be watched by fans of all ages. And it was directed by Albert Pyun, who made some really funny and dark films as his career started to take off.<br /><br />The story is about a young man named John Largo, (John Hurt), who works as an actor/paparron at a dance club where he falls in love with the manager/singer of the club Anna (Kate Capshaw), (Claire Daines) and they plan to have a baby girl with her famous \"Big Baby\" mother, (Lelia Goldoni).<br /><br />However, in the summer of 1945, Joseph Largo (James Woods) was kidnapped by the Nazis and was to go to England to find some information on Anna and her daughter. And it is only when John Largo and Claire Daines find out the Nazi scientists sent to them from England send a man to America, to destroy the man who saved his life back with his new baby's, (Hilgeby), that John Largo and Claire decide to stay.<br /><br />As usual, John Hurt is a great actor and he is a great actor, with a great presence. He also has a great presence and is very funny and he plays a great character in this film. There is a good message of life and he is in love with Claire Daines, (Lelia Goldoni) who is married to the leader of the Nazi's in America and she is trying to protect her from John Largo. <br /><br />There are lots of funny moments in this movie. The way we see John Hurt and Claire Daines dance, the way he sees Claire Daines and how the two fall in love and how they help each other out. There is a great chemistry and there is no one as the good guy in this film. Some funny scenes also include John and Claire falling in love with Claire and how Claire is not as bad as most people think to be. There is a lot of comedy and comedy in this film.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film and my rating is 8/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I've seen a lot of bad movies before this. A lot of them are well acted and are a lot smarter than this. They don't have many memorable scenes or any sort of entertainment value and only serve to bore the poor viewer. The director and the writer obviously thought this was something intelligent and should make movie people watch it. I'm afraid it's going to be in the cellar of this particular cellar. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ A very strange and wonderful film that really has nothing in common with film, as in real life anyhow. There are a lot of similarities and what to me seems has more of a plot in it. This film, though doesn't seem to really follow through with what the writer is hoping to accomplish. What I really have to say to the people who are going to watch this film, is to make sure, you don't forget that it is only a film by its writer/director, who you have no real involvement with. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I cannot believe that I didn't realize that this movie is in some kind of category of so bad it is actually good right from the very beginning. I mean, when I see a movie about a young girl dying in a mental hospital and I thought that the director was going to put a happy ending to the story, but instead she took away all of the interesting elements in the movie and just made one big long sequence of moments ending up in a sort of \"nothing\" plot, and that's exactly how I felt watching this film. I mean, the first scene where the girls are on the roof was so long, you didn't feel connected to them for a minute, the second girl dying on her own in a house that was never really renovated or cleaned, the first two guys dying on their own, they had nothing to carry on with from there on...<br /><br />This movie is pure crap. The acting is so very, very bad, and because it is a so bad it isn't even funny way too many times (I have a lot of problems with films that aren't even funny and I will not waste any more time writing about this piece of crap), you get the feeling you're not laughing, at least you hope. I do have to say though that the whole scene where the two brothers are fighting is the only good thing in the movie, it wasn't awful, but it didn't carry the story forward in any way, not\n",

      " together. This movie has some really funny moments, but I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />I really like the whole movie. Some things are so poorly done in this movie it's fun.<br /><br />3 stars for this good looking flick and that \"The King and I\" music. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is yet another boring, predictable and totally boring movie that somehow got put into theaters because they were able to secure the funding for this film using pre-tax contributions from the community. The plot is about a bunch of teens who go to an old school where they meet the man that built the school, their families and a mysterious doctor.<br /><br />There is plenty of predictable elements in this movie. The acting is so-so. The writing is poor, though it tries to make it seem scary in a few places. The direction is very bad.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is a bit slow moving, somewhat contrived and very very slow. It has little in the way of scares. I'm no horror movie buff, but the first thing that scares me isn't the actual movie quality but the lack of scares. This is a very average film in terms of the genre it belongs in. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The film revolves around the characters played by the two men who starred. You have James Woods (The movie was filmed in the Scottish Highlands, The movie was in Edinburgh in the late 70's and the man who played the man called JAMES WEBB also came back for more.) James Woods played a brilliant performance and was a great actor himself. He was very talented but the film was a disaster due to his inability to do anything but look and act to perfection.<br /><br />John Thaw (played by Peter Cushing in the film) is also very effective. John Thaw has been a big star for many decades and in many films was quite famous. He has great fun in this film. His performance is very touching, very believable and very well done. JENNIE BELL (The woman who played the girl's sister in the film also came back for more.) The film was filmed in the Scottish Highlands, the film was set in Edinburgh the year after George C. Scott's \"The Patriot\", the story involves a young girl and her father. In the film, it is a time for reflection on life and well-being and it is not uncommon for a film to have these two subjects having a scene or flashback which may be emotionally-ingested.<br /><br />I would recommend this film for anyone who loves the old movie genres that have the actors involved so that can't be taken in other peoples minds for a film. It is a film that you can watch over and over again. As it was made on a very tight budget this film is a real winner even today.<br /><br />For anyone who enjoy or knows this man, they should see it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ When I was a kid, my grandfather used to buy films for us to watch on a cold, snowy night. I got a really really good one here, called \"The Invisible Man\". And when I was a kid, I could understand what the guy was saying: \"Don't they have to be some kind of subtitles?\" So my grandfather would buy this and send it off to the front door. It was the biggest gift for the rest of my life and my grandfather. But when I was old enough to actually get my own bed, I was more than old enough to understand the subtitled version. So this is what I got, and in fact, it's so poorly done you can tell it was made by a junior high schooler.<br /><br />This film does nothing but piss in the big time! It has nothing to redeem it! If you want to see great films about the old, silent era, you'd have to look anywhere but to the movies. The best films in the history were made by people simply watching movies. There are some good looking movies like this, but they all should be subtitled as well. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ One of the more enjoyable films of the 70's (and I do not have the heart of anybody yet to be that cynical, but that really is not that hard). The first part of the story is based on the book (Bible about the Bible, or bible about the Bible) and involves two scientists that want to do something out of the realm of conventional wisdom for one reason and one reason alone, they have the power to change our evolution or our life span. The world needs them and we all need them for our survival (and the world will change because of them). They need life span extension to allow them to have this work done.

The problem comes in when we are forced to watch a really bad movie, a movie where our first impression will not be in line with whats going on at the moment.<br /><br />I hope this gives you an idea of when to skip this movie, and also where you should watch it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I remember watching this film as a kid...well not in the best light, however I remember this in the end! I used to watch it every Christmas or the New Year, but every year I missed it. It takes place in Ireland so it made sense for me to watch it and was a nice film to watch with my family back in Ireland. If you are or ever have been in this situation, please watch this film! This would not only explain the situation but would help you to understand what they went through and the person that did it. It does not mention the time, but you do get a good insight at seeing it now! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The movie is so far a worse than the book. First of all, it is so wrong about grammar that you could make a dictionary out of it. To the point where you have to look at it to understand what is going on, it says: \"The Spanish Civil War is a war of words and it ends with an ultimate victory for the enemy.\" Is that even correct? One of the biggest problems at the conclusion is that it doesn't take action at the end. Not a war of words has to go to war to be justified. It must go as a war of words or be a war of words. The reason for this is that the author is simply being ignorant of the historical reality. If the only purpose of the movie is to show what can really happen and what shouldn't, it has failed to make any impact. I cannot believe that any serious person would want to make a movie based on this movie. And it seems that all of the major networks (including NBC) are not broadcasting it again anytime soon. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a classic. It's so romantic and good and funny.<br /><br />I saw this movie years ago and I still love it today. It is a movie that can draw you in. <br /><br />And it gives you the feeling of a new and unexpected life that you can change with the time and time again. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie was not even close to perfect. The only problems with the movie are: 1) The animation is awful, it's very unrealistic 2) The music is almost entirely pitch black sounding, it's impossible to hear 3) The script is extremely bad, there is nothing to keep the interest throughout 4) The plot is completely unbelievable. <br /><br />This movie was a lot of fun for me but I never got it down. The main problem is that after a while it becomes boring. The whole movie is just too repetitive and too cartoonish. Maybe the movie's producer could try again making it more interesting and appealing. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ When watching this film, my mind kept saying, \"This is a bad joke. The main character in this film is such an idiot.\" So after watching the first 90 minutes of it, I thought, \"How did I end up in this situation?\" But to my relief, 90 minutes later I was still annoyed and still got the idea behind my mind's picture why the character in this film is so annoying. But what was with all the cursing and the silly music? How this could be a comedy I couldn't bear to watch any more. Why the hell did I keep watching? And it's my final comment, that if you've seen this film, you may want to go and look it up if you haven't. It's great to know you can't have all. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film is brilliant and is one of those films which would have made its way to DVD under the name of \"Gunga Din\". I was surprised to find it had not been moved to VHS or DVD and the description of its release states that the end of the last \"Muppet Movie\" has arrived. The movie is probably good enough for a single viewing. The one-liners are also pretty funny in their absurdity and are one of the last of a large group of movies that will not be followed with a theatrical release or TV. The cast is also good, the writing is good enough to make it in film form without getting too much preachy, so this may not be great TV series. However, it does offer the one good thing I can say about this movie\n",

Not only is it one of my all time favorites, but it is also my all time favorite animated movie. The storyline is very original, and in every situation the characters (aside from at the beginning where the evil prince tries to kill the Princess, a different character than usual) are wonderful. The Disney characters are charming, and the characters are not always the same, but they make a movie that is not too complicated or too complicated. Plus, if I had to guess the ending, I think I could give it to a Disney fan.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie.<br /><br />9 of 10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ When I saw this movie about 11-years ago on a local station I was shocked to find the title of it. I thought i was a hick. The premise of the movie was well done, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I think the problem is the movie. The acting, the writing, the graphics are mediocre. At times it looks like a second rate TV production. The story seems very much like a very bad high school drama. The plot is unbelievable, the story line is very bad, but I think the good guys really are the only true heroes (except the good doctor, I hate him).<br /><br />The worst part is the CGI, very often, it looks like they don't have CGI, sometimes you see a black dot appearing somewhere and sometimes it seems like that is it. They tried to do things with CGI, which is nice, not for nothing they also used a lot of it, but in a very few scenes with few shots. Also the acting is almost nothing, the good doctor does a very bad job, and he is so annoying. The bad actors also show their age (very old people are good), they are also all very good, and the bad actors also shows they need a good director, who knows nothing about animation or the animation industry.<br /><br />A good story is very good.<br /><br />The actors are so-so... They are just average. But, it also shows their inexperience in the film industry.<br /><br />Finally, the story is terrible. The CGI, that was a good idea in the movie is used again only for the ending and very few scenes.<br /><br />Overall: This is a good animated movie is also a good used, and the scenes in the used scenes are good. But that is only to be considered as a spoiler. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Having enjoyed the two previous versions of this story, this one must be a bit different. This is the story of a woman who became a prostitute as a result of sex work.<br /><br />The first 'Twilight' of the late '80s is a great treat. At least with the second installment, we get a better understanding of the character of Darlene's. In the preceding 'Twilight', I felt she could have been a bit more powerful and complex, but they gave her a real arc - at least, in the last episode. With this one, I just felt less of a character and more of a 'dame'.<br /><br />The best thing about the final 'Twilight' is knowing that the Twilight's of old were not all pure evil, like in the earlier 'Twilight'. I find myself watching this episode rather like the old-fashioned characters themselves. It is the way they react to a situation, and how they carry it out, that makes them great characters. This is because they are not always sympathetic; they always have a dark side, for example, when the 'sex worker' is forced into a job to have sex with the man he loves and loves her. But these characters are so human that this is a very rare thing for the 'sex worker'. They are the heroes of the story, and perhaps one day, they may be the heroes of just about everyone.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say though. It's not that this whole one didn't have a good story, it's just that it lacked a good story. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If for nothing else the producers made the movie available on DVD-ROM, they have succeeded. This is the first movie from director George Cukor, who has gone on to direct the award-winning \"The Island\" and win the Oscar for a \"coherent and effective meditation on urban cultural and psychological dilemmas.\"<br /><br />I cannot stress this one too much.

      " 2 one to go (well worth a look)<br /><br />1. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ What can you say about the movie. This is one of the worst movies ever. The story is nothing new. Only thing new is the gore and some nudity. The story is really slow and no tension is enough to make it an excellent horror flick. There are so many times throughout the movie you can see little cuts and the killer is obviously some sort of person, who's there to show some mercy to people like to watch his/her \"killings\". What a coincidence you should only be aware of. Then again, the movie is very predictable. So much so that it could not have made any mystery in the movie or the movie would have not have been made. This movie tries to make the viewer have some clue who is the killer like in \"The Others\" like in \"Halloween\" but this movie does not do that by giving no clues or keeping of a mystery or suspense which I don't think is the way to keep suspenseful atmosphere or suspense. I don't think this movie would deserve to be called a horror movie but a little thriller. There is no story or a story itself, it is just a man killing people. That is it. Same guy, same house, same time. He is a killer who is all alone with a house and no one to help him. Why is it no where near the truth? Also it feels like director has forgotten to make good movies. Maybe the story, as I believe, has an open mind and did not know how to use horror in the best sense of the word. Maybe he was trying to use humor in the movie and forgot that horror has the same feeling. Or maybe he was trying to use tragedy and forgot he was trying to show the world that horror is a very tragic thing. This movie tries to make a movie about an assassin who kills a woman. It is not about the story or the way he kills people. That is a story. The guy kills people. Is that the best I can say? What I think is the best I can say about this movie is that the killer does not have any connection with the man. He does not resemble the man, he looks like a psycho or some psycho but he does not do anything and he is not the killer. To summarize, I think that this movie is no good. There is no story or any story at all. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ First of all, i would say that this is not the first movie by this production company, i would have never expected something like that. Second of all is the fact that the cast is not very good. Third is the fact that some of the jokes are really lame.<br /><br />But on its own the movie is pretty good.<br /><br />Well, the first one was really funny and after that it just got more and more horrible, because this one was a complete mismatch of characters.<br /><br />The first movie was also terrible, but this one was even worse. As you can imagine, \"The Breakfast Club\" is a much worse movie, because it has an awful cast. This one was the worst movie from this production company.<br /><br />There is one good thing that the first movie did do for me, namely the fact that its conclusion did not take you as far as you expected.<br /><br />All i have to say about \"The Breakfast Club 3\" is, if you're not already tired and bored by the first movie and you feel that you don't have enough time for something a little more challenging, then give this two a shot! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film is not much of a documentary because it doesn't have any kind of storyline. It is a sort of inter-cut with vignettes dealing with subjects that either don't talk or have very little to do with the subject matter. The vignettes are often hilarious and even a few times are quite disturbing.<br /><br />The focus of the film is often the subject matter of the vignette, and we sometimes get a sneak preview of what is going to come next. Although the film sometimes seems like a bad made-for-cable movie with all its voyeuristic gags, the film sometimes can hold its own against the films of directors like David Cronenberg. <br /><br />This film is not really a documentary, but it does have some interesting stuff to tell about how the world of modern society is changing and in desperate need of answers to questions like \"Who is responsible for this mess?\" _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It's nice to see a movie like this made again.

      " (in the first half of the film) who, it transpires, were some sort of \"hero\" (I'm guessing here, but it isn't) - the kind that wants nothing more than to please his lady - that would give him pleasure, while turning his life into something worthwhile! - the very antithesis to something worthwhile-ness - so he puts himself right in the middle of this mess and has so many things going for him he's not even aware of where his own problems come from.<br /><br />The film's central, main theme is the one that is most disturbing in this film (not as disturbing as murder and possible suicide, but still a lot of problems), and that is what really gives the film its horror and horror-falseness - it concerns the problems and problems inherent in a loving relationship with your wife, the need to feel like a man, and the need to satisfy the cravings of men, who see the world in such a way that the men they see are no man, but women to some degree or another... At times, the relationship between John and Toni seems to be going nowhere. It doesn't feel that there's enough tension here, the romance seems pretty superficial and the film's plot is totally uninvolved. There's a couple of decent \"thrills\", however! The last third of the film has two of the more \"scary\" moments - the shower scene that gives the movie its \"twist\" towards the end, and the scene where they find out about John's suicide - but neither gives either character enough depth to give them life. <br /><br />Overall, it's a rather forgettable film that does offer a \"thriller\" at the very end - what this film needed more of - you know, if you really dig thrillers and horror films, this one's a must-see... _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is one of my favorite movies of all time (in no particular order). I bought this title (it was released in a deluxe box) at Borders. I bought it because it told the story of a man (Scott) who goes looking for meaning in life. After watching the movie, I realized that the story was based almost entirely around the life and deaths of these four folks. While the movie is primarily about the relationship of the four individuals, this is a very special movie. The ending, as well as the storyline of the movie, are both beautiful and tragic.<br /><br />While the movie portrays them fairly realistically, I found much to like about the film. For one thing, the way the story develops as a journey, rather than a drama, really brings the characters out into greater dimensions. And, as if what they do reflect about the larger, more complicated relationships involved in life, the film is certainly a worthwhile piece of art. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I watched this film and to me it was too funny. It was definitely a film that I laughed out loud and I left the theatre laughing for a few minutes. And I think the reason for my leaving the theatre laughing was that I couldn't stand the plot. It was just too laugh track material. The main character is a man who is going through a rough time and wants a girlfriend. He takes an ad in the paper and thinks it will really go to something. He gets an answer (no girl).<br /><br />What made this different was to me they had filmed some shots and then went and edited them out. I mean a film that you can laugh at it because of it's originality. I just found the whole \"making out\" (which is the whole humour of the film) stupid and stupid. They just went and put in some scenes that I didn't need to pay close attention to get the laugh track.<br /><br />The main character is a really irritating guy and you don't give much away about him and there are some scenes that make you glad you watched the film and don't give you any answers. The only good thing I can say about it is that it seems to be based on some real life situations and it does have a laugh track! :) _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a very poor and lame movie. All of the actors are very average and the entire film really doesn't have much to offer.<br /><br />Why did the director chose to waste the talents of James M. Cain as Sam? You will just have have to watch the movie once to understand. <br /><br />Overall, the movie is pretty and the characters are pretty. But, it's very poor and lame. If there was anything worse, I doubt anybody would care.<br /><br />The story - the idea of a man going a shopping mall, meets a blonde named Jennifer. The movie is very confusing and very dull and the scene is\n",

      " this. So that is the reason this movie wasn't rated in the rated range. I think we have to consider the number of people who would have to see this otherwise.<br /><br />Any movie that has the audacity of not being rated in the rated range must reflect the overall high opinion of the movie.<br /><br />You have my comment. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It is my understanding that only one review has been put on this film. It is very well written and directed. I am sorry that the director has chosen people who will only see this movie if they are already a fan of the film. Even some fans of this film probably won't be able to find the film anywhere on the world movie network. The movie is really worth watching for all the different aspects of this film. Just try to look for the big, big, big review on the web. It will not be found. Don't bother.<br /><br />The two main reviews, I think, are on IMDb. I have to think that the other review is for about a fifth grade class of children or something, I believe. It has nothing to do with the movie. It is also impossible, because he is already only writing a review for other sites.<br /><br />I guess I was disappointed to see all the positive reviews for this film from different countries. It's interesting that it has been a long time since I viewed it, probably four or five times, and I did not have any idea that this film would have such a negative rating. I will never know. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was going to comment on this film during a previous review; but I just found it, unintentionally, hilarious. This film is the exact opposite of Hollywood stinker - not stinker of bad taste, but a stinker of bad taste. This is a film that does have a point, but fails to make a meaningful statement.<br /><br />Yes, the film features all the clichés of a Hollywood stinker: the mother of the three most important girls, some silly fantasy life, a rich dad who is a 'conquest' target of his own children, a good guy who is actually a 'conquest' target, a hero 'who saves' the day or something, a hero with an agenda.<br /><br />A film so ridiculous that there were four or five times I thought about if the film was a comedy. I really did think the ending was a joke. A film so embarrassing that it made my reaction to the rest of the film seem so stupid, not even a smidgen of embarrassment.<br /><br />Not to mention, there is a scene of the movie where the main character's sister gets in with the local Mafia. I was thinking \"Really? That's Hollywood's equivalent of the American way of getting her hands on the F word - a prostitute who saves the day through the power of her beauty?\" and when that scene ended, I had the same thought.<br /><br />If you get the chance to see, don't bother - unless the film is called The Dukes of Hazzard because you've seen the Materia. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw the movie a week ago, and the reaction on the island was horrible, because everybody here doesn't even know about this movie and is afraid of it and that nobody's watching this movie anymore (they're all busy doing their other work). The only positive thing I can say is that the movie is very funny and very enjoyable even for today. This movie was made in 1998 in Estonia, there's a lot of other countries which have already made comedies or that. So people in Estonia can't really blame this movie for anything, but the best thing I can say to you is that there's a good movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie may well have been terrible. The acting was so terrible as to be laughable and the story is beyond ridiculous. This is, however, a great film that would give any of us who like to watch movies a real kick (unless we're at a film festival) and also gives us a good movie that is really funny and entertaining to watch. There's not one single bad thing you could say about the film, but I highly recommend it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film is amazing. From beginning to end I was completely wrapped up in it. The camera work is so fluid you see and feel everything. And what can I say about the scenery for a second. The story is so different from anything I have ever ever seen I can't believe it. This is a fantastic movie I would say it is destined to become a cult classic. It's just a fantastic film. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_\n",

      " better sense. I saw the movie when it first came out and it made me laugh. It's now a favorite at school parties - a must have in your library - because it's so funny! There are many jokes. And I think you'll just wanna enjoy it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ My god, what a movie. I don't know why I love movies so much, but I can't stop watching them. I watch 'King of the Underworld', 'Zombi 3' and 'The Dark Eye'. If you like zombies or monster movies, I think this is the right one to get you started. It's no masterpiece like 'The World is an Uninvited Mother', but it's definitely worth checking out, even with the low quality of the made-for-TV special. It's easy to understand why it's seen by so many people as a comedy/drama. <br /><br />The plot: The story is about a young man named Johnnie who is in the process of going through his new normal life after inheriting an estate in which he inherits all the inherited wealth. However, after the new normal life, there is a series of murders committed by two women to try and get their inheritance back. This leads the usual pathos with plenty of heart-warming scenes that make this a must-see movie. If you're not in the mood for this type of \"biopic\", you can leave this one alone... _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I must admit that I had seen this film several times in it's run, and every time I was repelled by some poorly acted part or just a completely ridiculous plot line - I had a friend or a friend with a better idea than to pull the plug...<br /><br />This film was a really smart one for its time, which was partly due to it's cast and it's use of stereotypes...<br /><br />I'm not the biggest Jackie Chan fan... I've thought that Chan is a really well constructed martial artist... but I just couldn't picture the gang fight scene (a lot like the Jackie Chan movies). I didn't buy that it was a movie about a real-life Chan master (although that was what I read in the cover)... though I'm sure they were trying to do that with the Jackie Chan film some years ago.<br /><br />But anyway, the gang fight scene was just a lot of fun and it's not a bad one... though I still don't really understand this theory about using stereotypes when you know what you're getting into. If you know that the lead is a boy and he's the black son of a man and they have a son of Chinese woman and Jackie tries to bully him... then you know his Asian father is a bully too, and we get a whole bunch of stereotypes... plus a few really irritating sub-plots... I didn't like that too much.<br /><br />But aside from all that I can at least say that this film is interesting... I mean there's always the same actor every time... or so I hear... and the same Asian gang fights scene... so I'm always intrigued for a new piece to come off my mouth... and there's a good twist of some of it... though I guess the last one didn't really feel like a \"good\" Chun Siun twist.<br /><br />So if you like films where Jackie Chan (and I think many other martial artists) are having bad fights or just plain bad plots, I think this would be worth a watch... _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this at my theater yesterday night, one of the most beautiful and moving movies I have ever seen. It was made on an extremely low budget and by that I mean it has a very nice feel about it, the scenes are shot in a very beautiful way and with great color and the music makes you feel like you just spend your time watching something. Plus i was really moved by the whole story which is telling the story about how a woman can lose everything and how a man can lose everything but how he manages to find himself in a very deep love in the end. This movie has a real sadness about it and I think the director should make more movies like this because I could cry in this one. This one is definitely worth seeing and that's why it is one of the best I have ever seen! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie seemed really stupid at first.<br /><br />But the acting was really good, and the movie is actually more than just a little bit of a escapist romantic comedy.<br /><br />I don't know if this is a musical, and considering the songs that were used in the movie, it is hard to tell, but the movies are heavily mixed together so it gives you the feeling of multiple\n",

      "ENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ What a great film! Yes, it is more than an homage to the Beatles and their music but it really goes a long way to explaining everything. It is not simply the story of the Beatles but their entire music history.<br /><br />The film isn't always good but it is good for what it is. When I first saw it I was not sure of what to think. But once I started to understand what it was all about and the many layers of their lives I started to enjoy it quite a bit. The film is quite emotional and at the same time quite funny.<br /><br />I find the film to be a great example of the power of film as art and as media. I do enjoy movies because of their ability to show a complex situation which is sometimes not obvious especially when you are not there. But it can also be fun and easy on the eyes especially if they aren't focusing on the film as the whole world is watching you.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to everyone. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If you are after the music of John Lennon, this movie is not for you. John Lennon as an artist deserves a lot better treatment than this. I do not understand what they are getting from this movie. The music that John Lennon wrote is great but it is not the same when the director is playing the music or when you are supposed to watch it. This is a bad idea. Watch the original Lennon/B Lennon work (The Love song) or the video. The original Lennon/B Lennon work is much better than this. Why the director thinks that the Beatles will be able to pull off another concert at Brighton is beyond me. It was the first concert by the Beatles and it can hold their own. The movie could have easily been with more songs and with a better group of musicians. I highly dislike this film and will not recommend the DVD to anyone unless there is really nothing else to watch. Even if it holds its own against the original Lennon/B Lennon music, this movie is the worst one I have ever seen. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I don't know what this is. It is a film about nothing. I am not a film critic so have no complaints about that. It fails to engage me in any of the drama or emotion in the film that it is trying to portray. It seems to me that the writer/director used every cliché in the book and then left out the ones not covered in the book. It is not a terribly impressive collection of clichés but not a very good movie either. My advice is to read a book on film-making and then watch this with an open mind. It really IS nothing. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it at all. It is a story based on what they found in the Antarctic. It is just another cheap story with a few interesting facts added.<br /><br />I am still not sure whether the facts add up to an actual story or not. But I am not one of those who can stop from looking at the facts.<br /><br />That's a fact. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw this film at the film festival in Ann Arbor. The festival was held in the summer, so the film festival got a chance to show this film in the winter. The film was a blast; it was full of great characters and situations. The acting was top notch; everyone was amazing. It was also interesting to see that there are two of them! There is a big rivalry going on between a rich father, played by one of Henry Fonda's best friends, and a poor farmer, played by another of Henry Fonda's best friends. While one is working, his rival is using his own greed, and cruelty to destroy anyone unfortunate enough to be watching the other. I think the film could have been much more successful with more characters. I think it was a good idea to film this as a family film.<br /><br />The film, of course, is very entertaining and a real treat for the family. There are some funny situations, but the film also has great drama and tragedy. There are some great performances and some great humor in the film, too. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I don't know about any movies I have ever watched by this director and by far this is THE WORST MOVIE EVER BARRED OR CINEMA. I've seen some pretty high budget movies, but this one is terrible. Even my husband who loves the 90's B-movies couldn't stop laughing his head off at this poor excuse for a film. The acting was horrible, the dialog was terrible and the directing. It was awful. I would highly suggest not seeing this movie if\n",

      " English or just plain old white trash, then I highly encourage you to listen more. It's very interesting to watch women that live in the same situation they are in - and think \"Hey, this is real-life as it goes!\" It's a lot more interesting to see people with real-life problems - and see how they're treated. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ OK.I'm coming to you from a kid who's never even watched 'My God, What a Waste of Time'. He insists on it. Well, there's something really special about 'My God, What a Waste of Time'. I don't know about the world of 'Wasted', but I do know that this movie deserves the high rating it gets. This is one very bad movie. What's so good about it is the cast, including the \"Star Wars\" clones: Ray Corrigan is a baddie. The director thinks that there's a way to have cute, unthreatening male actors in action roles, but none of them could do a convincing performance. One of the \"star attractions\" of the flick is the director's own daughter. I don't know why she was in this movie. She's very bad. I've had my own daughter's friend say to me \"What was the deal with the camera?\" She lives in Mexico (where?) and she never ever tells me what a bad movie she's ever seen and that they all say it was bad. Maybe that explains why Ray Corrigan doesn't act in her movies as a foreign man-hating Mexican? _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This was the second movie I have ever walked out of before the end. I had seen a lot of good movies in the last few hours but this was simply awful. There was nothing in the movie of any merit whatsoever-not once did I start to understand anything that was actually happening. Even the little bit I did grasp was so little that it couldn't possibly have been made by a second grader, much less by the director I assume to make some money with this film. I honestly don't think that I could have put ten lines in the review to be more accurate. The plot had no substance, the acting was terrible and the \"action\" scenes were too brief to be in any sense relevant. I can't even believe that the director was still in film school...he must have been in Charge of the entire production of this film. The only person who would have saved it from being a terrible let down would be the author(s). That person should be made to watch this movie more than once and then forced to watch it again to see if only he had learned something from it. <br /><br />It is a real shame that this film is in the negative ratings of IMDb, as it is a good movie with decent acting. I didn't have the worst movie experience of my life and I don't want that to happen again. I was fortunate to have viewed \"The Glass Menagerie\" with two other friends and we both found it to be a \"light-hearted\" and \"fun\" night out. The Glass Menagerie is an important film, which many people will look to as a teaching tool in the subject of evolution. Unfortunately, you will probably learn something from this movie and will be able to ask yourself certain questions regarding the faithfulness of your faith in the church and God. <br /><br />If you are looking for something to watch on a Sunday night where you can laugh at the awfulness of this movie, or just get your head blown off as the first, avoid this one. This is not the way to go. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I was so excited to see this movie because it sounded incredible from the beginning and I saw an interesting teaser at the beginning and read the reviews very carefully to really see that this was the best horror movie I would ever see. First of all there are bad movies you shouldn't even waste time or money on, but still I have found that the preview from the beginning was very promising. As I had read the book and had read all of the reviews on here and also had the chance to see several plays in theatres which were shown the preview in. So when the previews came for the theater I knew that my time and money was worth the trip. When it came out the reviews made this one appear extremely misleading and this one definitely does not have the same type of quality that I have for other movies.<br /><br />The acting was so bad and so was the film, but it has to be said that I like very much the performance that is done here. The script and the direction are also not what you would expect from a German director and this is definitely very hard work and talent with the actors and director doing an excellent job.

As the movie opens one first suspects that the film was originally meant to serve as a \"bizarre comedy\" but one soon begins to believe that it was made to express a profound message. Even the main character seems to have some level of deeper meaning.<br /><br />The movie's structure reminds me of an episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" (although I did not make it a habit of watching that show). The main character's attempts at communication with his family and friends are cut in half by a lack of a sufficient directorial control, with a lack of resources beyond the personal camerawork. The main character's paranoia is palpable throughout, but he is eventually shown to be a deeply understanding individual whose behavior is at odds with his coolly observed actions. One of the most powerful elements of the film is the ability to draw upon the reader's life experiences to comment on them in a way that is both personal yet well-developed. <br /><br />The result is a movie that moves well beyond the boundaries of what is good and what is bad.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film and will look out for it in order to see how it is done right again, because I understand how it could be done quite well.<br /><br />I agree with some in the comment thread, that the film's title, which I believe is appropriate, underlines the lack of a truly professional answer to the question why there is this kind of mystery and why there isn't one. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I've read the reviews here and the general consensus seems to be that a lot of people were expecting something along the lines of a Hitchcock thriller or something along his route to the heart of the movie. After the first 10 minutes of this movie I thought it might be good, but it really wasn't. It is a lot of fun, that's for sure, but it starts to become quite boring towards the mid-point. It also starts to drag towards the end when the girl realizes that she's pregnant, (or her boyfriend finds her on the floor with her belly) and the mid-boss thinks that it's time to take the girl home.<br /><br />I think it would have been much more interesting to have the girl get her abortion to prove to mid-boss (not that I've seen that yet) that she loves him. But instead it just shows that mid-boss to his wife that he's a selfish individual as well. <br /><br />The plot had potential with the main character showing that he likes her, and being a good friend of the father, being the mother, all things that could have caused something very interesting from that situation. Unfortunately, the ending was poorly-observed. I suppose the end is that mid-boss is seen by mid-boss's wife as the guy in control of everything that he doesn't personally choose, but it also ends there because mid-boss was in control of everything.<br /><br />One thing that I like the best of this movie is that I couldn't wait for it to end. I was going to turn it off after the 5 mins and was in a state of complete shock at how long it was remaining. I guess all things considered, I thought this movie was good and could have, but I just really didn't mind. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie in \"Elvira\" in a film festival when it was supposed to be \"Elvira: The Movie\" - the film is just about to start showing in Britain. I've decided that I liked the little bit of the trailer, but that's about it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The second movie of James Bond, after his first: no sequel, is even a bit of a joke: they got all this money for making this second movie. And the fact is, even the best of movies is still no sequel to the first. So, no one cares about the whole \"Bond films\", but just a few good actors, very good, very clever. I thought this was a brilliant movie, and my favourite role of James Bond, and yes I liked the villains, because the film was simple, and almost the same one, with the new actors: no new villains, even the new ones...

      " By its nature, most people just don't get beyond the basic horror that it is to watch this type of film and simply say, \"Awh! it's a good little flick!\"<br /><br />Now, I've seen this type of movie a number of times and always enjoyed it. I'm not a horror freak (or anything like that), but a fan of supernatural/horror movies. And if the movie didn't have the great acting, the suspense, what the story, the twists that made it a good movie, and overall story lines, I probably would have given it a \"1\" rating.<br /><br />So, I really appreciate the effort that Mr. Dorman put into his effort and I feel sorry for that very bad movie that \"The Devil's Backbone\" and \"The Silence\" were paired together. There is so much to discuss, it's almost unbelievable how this film was paired together. So, for those of you who are fans of horror, I say this in this in the short term viewing that this film got.<br /><br />Now, a more up-to-date review. The first 10 - 15 minutes of the movie was the most promising of the film. It provided some great music and was the reason that I rented it. But, nothing really excited me as of October 1998 when I returned the film to VHS and it was still in a \"1\" rating. So, I'd never heard of the \"Tiger\" before. It reminded me of a bad remake, \"Scream\" with it's little touches: no makeup and no blood. It was actually kind of a bad movie I was waiting for for the \"Tiger.\" (Tiger? I don't think so...) So, I rented the DVD, and while it is an excellent movie, it still isn't worth it. It looks nothing like \"The Silence.\" It simply isn't scary enough. What in the world is a Tiger anyways? The plot just isn't there. So, the film still isn't worth a fraction of the movie that it was going for, but they can't be all that bad at the same time.<br /><br />A better movie would have been for the director to really build up a sense of \"tiger\" lore in his story. But that effort just wasn't there. Instead, he simply had a series of things happen that he decided should be frightening. No character were quite scary. I didn't really enjoy the \"Tiger\" as I remembered him in the previous films. And there was no real character development in this movie. It was like he was walking around without a costume on, just sitting there, acting out a scene and acting out scenes of scenes from other movies. There was no suspense.<br /><br />Also, the movie starts with \"The \"Tiger\" being shot down by choppers. Then he runs around shooting people. And it seems he's a good shot. No gore...just the gore. And then the \"Tiger\" is seen shooting people. It doesn't make you want to jump, it's not even scary, just sick. Also, the scenes showing him shooting, and not shooting, then the body...it didn't scare me at all, it was just disgusting and disgusting. He had a mask on, but was still scary.<br /><br />There were a few deaths that were quite gruesome...but nothing in the movie really frightened or bothered me. And then he suddenly runs around shooting again. The ending is rather good, if you ask me. I give it a 9...or just a 4.<br /><br />This is a good movie if you look for it, but even if there's only one review out there that gave it a \"1\"...you might want to watch it. It's one thing watching a movie for 100 seconds, but paying more than 60 in full...and just not caring about the ending, will hurt for you and your opinion of it. But if you're willing to give it what it comes under, give it what it comes under. It's not bad, but it's not good. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ OK, I'll admit it, this movie probably is one of the worst 100 films I've ever seen. I like bad movies so I watched this on TBN and I was happy. It has a great plot, characters, dialogue, and acting. There are lots of people who love this movie so I'm going to list some of my favorite quotes. The first 10 minutes or so of the movie had me hooked. The next 20 minutes were so bad because I thought I'd love it even more but found out the best way to survive was not to read between the lines. The movie really went nowhere and I was left waiting for it to finish. The next 20 minutes really were no where near what I had expected. I really liked the end. The last\n",

      "><br />But the real reason this film is a classic is because one of the main characters is a very bright and accomplished woman. The actress, Mitzi Rommel is a very good actress and I was never more glad to have seen her. As a result of her brilliance a lot of people were comparing this film to Tootsie; however, in my opinion this film is in no way inferior to its predecessor(the film it's called is also a masterpiece). It's worth a look; if only you're an \"experienced\" collector of silent film. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ There are two movies \"A Night at the Opera\" and this one starring the wonderfully played Rolfe Bechtler.<br /><br />This one features a story written by one of my favorite authors, Tolstoy.<br /><br />The screenplay of \"Ot-opera\" is excellent and will probably stay with me through life. The story and acting in this one are wonderful.<br /><br />This one is a must see if you love theater. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"Zabriskie Point\" was a wonderful film of a young man living an extraordinary and unique life. It had lots of secrets, it had twists and turns that just made you gyrate to the music.<br /><br />This film is worth a look for anyone that is interested in how people learn as they move from one place to the next.<br /><br />I found this film fascinating and it is probably the most important film in my life.<br /><br />All of the cast was very good and the script was quite complex and interesting. The acting, except for John Rhys-Davies was good, and I found every word of every sentence was very believable. I have no idea of how many twists and turns this film had, but I think anyone that has ever been in love or have been in love with someone, I think that whoever the writer behind this film was, I think that I have all known someone like or have know someone like that I could not possibly know.<br /><br />This film is wonderful if you love the characters, you love what they go through, you love what comes to mind, you just love how the characters are able to get each other out of things.<br /><br />I loved all of the characters in this film.<br /><br />It was just a great film, I thought. :D _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A few people say that Jules Dassin was not the worst director since, well for this film, THAT'S THE POINT! This film is, in spite of a few faults which should be pointed out at the beginning or at the end of the film, a truly awful film. Why? It contains a complete waste of 90 minutes of film. Jules Dassin should be hanged for the murder of a cat in 1984, but in the film, he is actually the murderer. The reason this film is a total failure is because the film is a poor imitation of the best work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and, even worse, the best work of all time: the great Darden's THE THIRD VOYAGE, which was a disaster, but not as complete a total failure. Jules Dassin directed that film and Jules was the main reason. But in that film, there should have been a character, that should have been, but that the film had a plot and script of a man who had to stay at a deserted island. How did things get bad? Because the characters in this film were too poor in both story and acting, so badly played that they should have been replaced by robots. But that is the fault of the film, not the fault of the character, that was in the very first film (even though that second film was also a disaster.) I'm not angry at the actors for the horrible performance of a few of them.<br /><br />This film is even so bad that I have to question the concept of Jules Dassin: he is not a good director. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Let's not insult the intelligence of all the people who know the truth, and to all fans of the classic film - 'Oh my gosh - Why are they making this movie!'. What they see here is nothing but 'shocking to the senses', yet this film has been given rave reviews - why? Because they don't understand what it looks like and is not in the film. What is disturbing is the fact that many 'trolls' are in this mess, and that the 'director' is someone who's actually a troll, someone who takes the film seriously and not just some random person who just likes to play at being the director. There really are people who actually like this\n",

      " is a nice fun movie with good music, very colorful scenes, good effects and a cool suspense plot. It has the classic story of two girls who are thrown together through a friendship of men, who come from various places. The two friends are trying to find their way home, but when they cross the street, they run into trouble. The first scene shows the two girls going into the woods to look for food, it is very descriptive scene.<br /><br />The story goes on for a long time until it finally gets to the end. I thought I was going to see a really good horror movie at the movies, but they ended up making a really bad movie. There is one great twist in the story that gives a reason why they are crazy and why they had such great luck in finding the two girls, who have become lost for a long time. You just have to wait to find out what happens.<br /><br />The action is fast paced and really cool. The music is pretty amazing and has some really good effects and are excellent use. The ending is good, but was also a little a bit short.<br /><br />The acting was OK, although I didn't like some of the characters, I thought some of the characters were kinda over-used. There were a few characters, like the older one with no-name character, the one with a name like \"Vince\" who is a good guy, the one who is really smart, and the other girl. They could use some more characters in the middle of the movie.<br /><br />There are a few plot holes, but the story doesn't get very deep that is really fun to watch.<br /><br />I give 7/10 stars for the amazing music. For a really boring movie, this is a real good one. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"The Story of Mankind\" is a great movie! I am so glad that I didn't watch it in English, I actually wanted to use Italian subtitles to show my respect for this great movie! Well, this movie is the first of the trilogy (the one I have yet to watch) to focus on technology and knowledge rather than power. It is also very different for it's time, since it focuses on humans using technology much more slowly and let's say. This movie is not just like Terminator! It shows us what happens when technology gets too powerful, in the future people have to use their powers wisely! The whole idea is very good, and in that respect, it is great! The characters are also very good, and the movie doesn't waste an actor at all! A very very good movie! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The story, and acting, is, I would say, fine, if not the direction.<br /><br />In the wrong context, it can be as good as \"In Cold Blood\", \"The Godfather\", or \"Sideways\".<br /><br />A low budget drama.<br /><br />It's worth seeing. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ If you want an awesome movie that you will laugh yourself silly out of your wits. Watch this movie. It is amazing. Every time you watch it you will feel like a kid again thinking about it and thinking about your grandmother. If you want a story that you cannot forget after a week or two. Watch this movie and you will not want to go back. You won't care who the kids are and what those kids will do for a month or maybe two years, but will still remember the plot line and feel your emotions like a year. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I rented the film because of the premise (which is interesting considering that it's an Italian film) but because no one else in the cast spoke Italian (not even Toni Servillo, who plays Daniell) I was also confused about whether it was just a Italian or US film (because the film is set in NYC). And I did not expect a masterpiece like \"El Duce of the Fall\". I was so impressed with the film that I purchased a copy. It's funny how Italian films get rated higher than US films (e.g. it was rated ten in the US, which isn't really that good because that's just American-made). Anyway, the story involves a guy named Daniell who thinks he's a superhero (which he looks like). That's all you get to see in this movie until about ten minutes into it, when everything unravels quickly into a bunch of very funny, confusing situations. In contrast, other low budget Italian movies I have seen (and, for various reasons, always rated lower) are more in your face, far more detailed, and more focused on the story and characters. \"El Duce of the Fall\" is a movie that gets into everything that I just mentioned\n",

      " to get the most out of it. I am very surprised it does not have more people following it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"Cocktails for Two\" has a funny but quite disturbing cast; Michael J. Fox plays a psychiatrist who tries to help two characters - the alcoholic (Robert Evans) and the shy but loving father (James Franciscus). The story is interesting, but unfortunately the film really comes off as a cheesy 80s-style horror comedy. James Franciscus plays his character like a mild and uncharismatic version of his part in \"Frasier;\" the supporting cast includes Pamela Benson as the confused daughter, and Susan Strasberg who isn't a bad actress but doesn't have much to do since her character is just one of the three \"cameos\". James Franciscus is the hero of the picture, and his performance is solid (and probably the highlight of the picture) as the doctor tries to help the main character. Unfortunately, the movie is rather pointless and overall rather boring, even for someone like me who is a big fan of cheesy horror comedies. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ One of my friends brought this film home; we had the option of skipping the entire sequence entirely or seeing only the second of three stories that make up the middle of the film. Instead, we ended up seeing each story at least three times in an hour. It's not much fun--much of what happened seems silly, and the movie overall seemed rather \"off\" and disjointed. Still, I'd be willing to overlook the silliness if they were a little more coherent, and that seems to be what the people involved wanted, so I'm not sure what the writers were going for. <br /><br />* 1/2* out of **** _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The first time I saw this movie, I was somewhat impressed at all the way it was shot with such a low budget, but once I got used to it I found out the story was a bit more complex. The movie starts off showing the kids in the small town making a bet, they either get married or they go to church, and then comes upon a little girl walking around the small kitchen. They figure a wacky little thing like her could be anything going, so to get the wacky little thing out of the kitchen they set out on a date. This date proves unsuccessful for some reason, the girl leaves. Then they go down a lake, and find the girl has been captured by the lake monster. After this movie, I was really looking forward to the release of The Thing, but once it would come in theaters it was going to be a wait and see situation. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was surprised that my first encounter with this film occurred in 1967, years after \"The Wog Boy\".<br /><br />In my world, \"The Wog Boy\" became an early example of a cheesy teen-horror flick, with the least-interesting character (the female lead), the most stereotypical character (the cop, played by a man, who claims to be a \"wrestler\" in every scene), the most silly \"plot\" (the teacher gets possessed and turns him into a wacko), and the most unbelievable ending (where you believe that a wanko is a skinny, scantily-clad young woman, because there is no character development behind the premise). <br /><br />\"The Wog Boy\" has always been my favorite of the three \"Wog Boys\" (the second one in fact came as a close second), and as someone who's never seen \"The Worst Parents on the Planet\", I won't be buying or renting this film. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have to agree with every single negative comment so far.<br /><br />This film is terrible in every single way possible - script, directing, acting, cinematography, and story...to mention only acting, as I know it is impossible to give this movie even this many negative ratings.<br /><br />I watched it because it was on T.V. and it had a 30-second preview and I was bored to death...but I could just barely endure ten minutes of that crap! I am NOT joking when I say that it is not only ridiculous, but extremely boring to boot.<br /><br />I would NEVER recommend anyone to watch this film...I would feel ashamed to even think about letting my family, or my sister or anyone else, see it, and I am extremely anxious to find out who this film was intended for, and what their opinion is on why this film and what the film went down in the ratings. I have heard absolutely nothing from people who have given this film more than 8.5/10.<br /><br />\n",

      " Temple, which I think was the location of the TV show. She and Mr Walker's son (Sean) had a relationship. It was never explored much, but from what I did see and hear of the relationship, it was obvious that it had left the father alone and had him living off his income rather than care for his family. It turned out not to be a problem because Sean had a great childhood and was able to work a career and raise a family with his ex wife and one of his two children. He is a nice guy and he's worked on the show for years and has not forgotten his love for the show. There was so much negative speculation about this relationship that I found really difficult to believe and I am sure that one day, people will come forward with much more information and will be able to speak to people like Sean and say \"It was so many years ago that I actually went to the USA and I was just wondering what happened to him\". _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ There have been a few movies that have scared me so bad, i felt compelled to give a 10 in the votes. This is the worst film of all time.<br /><br />The plot seems simple enough: two friends have a nightmare on their minds that are followed with a nightmare. They dream about waking up and seeing someone who owns a gun. All, there is only one of them, he and she, are trapped until one of them is killed. But they have a plan; someone is out to get them.<br /><br />The whole film is a complete joke, not funny or scary at all. I honestly don't know how to feel about it, but i did see an episode while i was drunk, which was so bad that i had to turn the channel. And guess what; a movie really sucks if you have drunk eyes. The worst thing about this movie is that i hate people who give it 10 stars.<br /><br />I gave it 3.5/10, i don't know what else to say. If your a guy, this movie is for you. If your not, dont waste your money, it was that annoying. Even the girl couldn't make a better movie, i swear. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ One of the great things about the original television series was the ability of the TV show to be seen by a large audience. So why did the series become such a disaster? The plot was too stupid, and as someone else commented, very unbelievable. Who could really make up an episode with the \"clues\" in just minutes? The episode I wanted to the most was: \"In his prime, a very thin, and VERY TALL, John Patrick would most likely have played the big part of his career, and made a great contribution to the game of cricket\". This character was so unrealized that I started to cry.<br /><br />Why did he die? Because his career as a player was so over, so what did they want to see? He was only allowed to play for England, not in the AIFF. Who cares about him as a potential captain when he plays every game at No. 8? Or, as a young \"youngsters\" like him were playing at 19-20? Maybe if he retired early and played in the AIFF, maybe! And did they really think the fans would have wanted him to be England captain? This is the biggest problem with the series. It just isn't funny - not the least at least as a throw back to before the series began. After all the \"celebrities\" (such as Richard Attenborough) of the television show, how could you imagine that they would have anything to do with this disaster? _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I was very disappointed, but then again, with this film, this is not much...especially for the budget and acting that was involved.<br /><br />The acting was fine, it was just the writing and directing that sucked.<br /><br />The scenes that were shot were VERY badly written (and the movie was made in a matter of days, that is, in a studio).<br /><br />Boring film to end. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film is a great example of how a good story can be complicated, and very, very complex, in the first place. I do not think I could have been more sympathetic to the character of The Patriot. I did not have a problem with the execution of the movie. No, I totally did not. I think that this movie and the first two were the greatest of all-time. They literally changed my life! I think that the director was obviously trying to give the movie a lot of credibility. I absolutely love the first two, and I really do think that The Patriot was a fantastic film!! I give it a 9\n",

      "uing in some of the scenes) I'm so not sure if the film in general will appeal to anyone. But I've seen this film, and it appeals to all of us parents (parents are a group that I do not know from, but I feel that there are some in the group that would find it entertaining).<br /><br />It really seems to have a happy-go-lucky feeling that I like, and all the other reviews seem to do, not only to me, but also to parents that are not particularly concerned with what their children are watching or reading on their morning TV. So, maybe this is what we need to look for in some movies....<br /><br />I can't really say that I would recommend it. Like most others, this movie really does have a lot of heart, but that does not always make for good movie-watching. I know, I'm not a bad person. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ When I was younger I remember watching this movie. To be honest the first time I did not laugh a lot. Then as the years went on I started laughing a bit more and more and now some 15 years after my viewing of this I still can't stop laughing. This movie is probably one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is so unbelievably stupid that I really do not believe it. There are so many things in the movie that are beyond belief such as the part-human robot, the part-cyborg and a part-human guy who has super strength and can fight against the top guy in the arena. You get the picture. And there is also such a lot of stuff in the movie that makes no sense and is completely useless like the evil person's evil super boyfriend, the evil judge and of course the stupid plot and dialog. But this movie is also full of great lines and I will just tell you now many, many people have said that this movie is one of the greatest movies ever. Well, I feel that you should judge and decide for yourself. I would just like to tell you now I enjoyed it so much that for a year I went to the opposite direction and I was a complete dunderhead. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The film is an example of how all of the major professional leagues in the world can produce quality television. It is so interesting how their players react to the challenges before them which require them to become better players. The performance of the players and how they deal with the expectations and the stress of the demands placed on them by the \"modern day.\" What a wonderful story and it is a story with real meaning to me. A film for all to enjoy. I look forward to the next film from the players of the majors as well. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The final scene and title of this film is a good one. When you think \"Babel\" is the best of the four, you know something special. How wonderful then that so many talented people had so much fun in making a film with such an amazing story of an American \"bloody little war\" is a film I would highly recommend to \"Dukes of War\". _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I can't believe the quality of the acting in this movie, or even the directing. The \"I'm gonna win this thing\" speech when Bobby says, \"This is the greatest\" speech that Bobby ever gave was a good example of how \"great\" a golfer Bobby was. If you can find the book this movie is based on, you must have a lot of golf to learn.<br /><br />The most unbelievable thing about this movie, is that the guy who wrote the book makes it seem like Bobby was almost as good as Sammy Lee Curtis. Bobby was not even a top 5 golfer when this movie was made, but then again, he wasn't even in the top 1000 overall either.<br /><br />The film was very poorly done, so poorly that it is unbelievable. The title should have been the \"I'm gonna win this thing\", and not the \"I'm gonna win the tournament\" speech.<br /><br />The DVD was not bad looking, but the sound was terrible. Sometimes when the sound was scrambled it was hard to hear what was said. This is a bad example of such horrible recording.<br /><br />The DVD was worth it just for the championship scene at the end, but then I got my time back. Don't waste your time unless it is the last thing on your mind. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie when I was about ten years old. And I liked it. It had it's moments, and was for my generation. It was also one of the most important and exciting science fiction films until I was thirty. I was also an avid film buff at the\n",

      "br /><br />Now lets get down to the performances. Michael Imperioli and David Warbeck both give solid performances, though neither one really comes close to making you care about either of them. The real star of the show, though, is the gorgeous, but illusive, young Mary Louise Parker, who gets to work in an unusual way. <br /><br />She never seems to lose focus, she never seems to get lost again. It shows. This is a show she will stay away from, but we won't let her. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie when I was in school and my thoughts on it all I can tell you is this: <br /><br />I am 18 years old and I have never seen anything like this film. It just made me crazy and I will definitely never forget this film, but I can never remember the name of the film. I saw the real version of this movie while I was studying in Australia.<br /><br />I'm 17 now and I love it and I will never forget these things I saw on the movie: <br /><br />First thing first: There were so many great scenes. It was such a big surprise how such great cinematography was behind a fake trailer. Second, the story of the girl, the way it was going and how it was put together. After watching that I became more familiar with the film and it's story like an episode of a movie.<br /><br />The story is not like you'd want it to be, there is not a \"bad\" or a \"just bad\" side to this film. Some moments where the stories could have been a little better but I'd give them a 9 out of 10. If you aren't into fantasy, I'm sure you won't get many movies at all. But I really don't mind.<br /><br />If you are, you'll love it.<br /><br />9 out of 10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I have recently seen this once again and can honestly say it is one of his best. As the old saying goes \"Every film needs a story in it otherwise it is just another fimlic\". The music and the main score of this film is incredible. The characters are very well drawn and endearing and the story unfolds quite smoothly. You never feel like there is a plot, it's just all so different and yet you never feel dull/stupef on the whole film itself you just care about the characters. I will never forget the joy I felt when I sat down watching the final scenes and was truly blown away by the final film. All I can say again is a great performance from Cern and one of the very best performances to ever grace a great screen. If there is one film I've ever wanted to see - it is the one that should never be ignored. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I love this movie. It is full of funny moments but also many different story lines and many different ideas. I particularly enjoyed the final scene (that was also my first part in the movie) a lot because of the way it was carried out. My favorite parts were when Harry left or when he was going away or away with the other girl (I was a little older). I would recommend anyone who is about the same age to see this movie. This kid really did take it seriously. You can see some real emotional scenes but they have to be somewhat humorous at times. When he leaves to go home, you really feel the loss. And when he is home it feels more like an escape to let your mind wander off to other things. The acting is really good. And the way the filmmakers made every scene was so fantastic. I watched this movie from start to finish with great enjoyment. The ending was awesome. I could have liked it if it had actually been funny. Maybe a 4/10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie was the most awful film I have EVER seen. The entire movie was so bad. This makes me want to go kill my computer and then watch the rest of it. I can't believe I watched it for 8 hours. My friend got the tape of the DVD and he liked it. And why did they use it as a scare tactic before the actual event, instead of just letting us see the monster for the 5 seconds or so??? I was laughing just thinking of how lame it was before the actual movie came on, the director should've just said 'OK people, it's coming out on DVD and it'll get the same rating as this film.' And all he'd have done is sent me a copy of this film and I'd have been happy. What did his wife do? She was probably the happiest actress in the world as hell before filming started. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_\n",

      "! I think everyone has seen everything. I think everyone knows this kid and what a goof. I think everyone knows what a jerk is. These children are kids that have never had a job, have never gotten a good paying job, and have no purpose in life. This film has no purpose.<br /><br />They are just stupid people. I know them. I know how hard they work and how much time they sacrifice to contribute to making toys for children. They are the children I wish existed in the world so I could show them these toy commercials. I hope the day this movie was released one will be killed. I hope that one will not come back and try to make others forget these children.<br /><br />Now, I will go on to describe the film. It is an awful movie. I don't even know where to begin. This is just awful. The main actor that portrays Rooft is a poor talent, who will not learn his lines because it hurts his chances at getting another leading role in a film. If you really want a good laugh, rent this movie and you will have a fantastic time. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have no problem with the fact that the movie was made for TV and aired before the advent of the miniseries. I am just puzzled why ABC would think there was a market for this one episode. I remember back when I went out to Blockbuster they only ran this DVD. I thought this was the episode for my movie collection and I have never seen the series. It was so bad that I can only recommend this to you to check out. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film starts very poorly, and I found myself wondering a lot about what was going to happen to the characters and what made them behave in their own way. I tried so hard to believe I was part of the movie, but the story did not hook me at all.<br /><br />There was a bit of a twist in the end: you must have been wondering if you were in the right place at the right time to know everything. I have seen similar films from that director (see for your own sake, 'Tenderly Vows, a Woman of Honour', etc).<br /><br />A very good movie, I do think I agree with some of the other comments which make the movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I've read the book, and read it twice. The novel is very good. I liked the movie. It's fun to look at the characters when they are not behaving like teenagers. <br /><br />I was very pleased in the books when I saw the novel. I liked the part about how the kids came up with their names, and was surprised how well it stuck with me.<br /><br />The actors did a good job, and the actors who played the main children weren't at all unpleasant. I'm very happy that this is in the books. It just makes me happy to read them when I get done watching the series every two years. I also like when actors play the adults in the series.<br /><br />I wish we had seen more of the girl. Although the girl is very mysterious, the book's story is much more complex. There is something about the girl that is what's interesting. I liked how they got the ending and the cast changed to give us more of the actor's character. <br /><br />Also, in the TV version, the whole thing with the kid falling, and all these things go out of scope. The kids are in the movie, but there are things they don't get explained in this TV movie. I could not understand anything about it. I can't remember anything else.<br /><br />All I can do with it is give it a 1/10, and maybe I just did not get the film. I do not recommend this to anyone. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I was a little disappointed with the acting in the film. I think the actors have a great talent, but lacked some realism in their performances. This movie does have a \"typical American family, with a daughter, and she may or may not be good looking.\" It was only one of the many movies I have seen with this woman, and I was not impressed with her performance.<br /><br />If the film had some more acting, it would have been more realistic in nature. In this film, the woman does everything (for herself and others) to avoid the adult. I could see where it would have been good for her to take another role at this age. There is a lesson to make here that it is okay to grow up. But to grow up and become an adult, no child should have to be perfect as her parents.<br /><br />There was much of the film missing\n",

      " monlottere's movie \"Mannikino\" is a fun watch for many reasons (including the score which is one of the best I've ever heard), but mostly it's an entertaining farce set in the world of entertainment. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw 'Dead' after seeing 'Klute' at age 16; in hindsight I don't think I could have been any more skeptical of Christopher Lee's ability to carry a movie. I'm one of those die hard die-hard Klute fans who can't quite grasp why other fans of a given star don't appreciate him, or the fact that many of these stars have chosen to retire rather than enter the fray at the twilight of their glittering careers. I do have respect for Lee's inability to adapt to the script, and have learned to understand it. I also have a respect for him for stepping so far into a completely different genre. The movie itself is the product of a collaboration between Lee and director Robert Menontz, and it was made for the ultimate screen party: film night! You have to be in stitches to get this flick. It's got a perfect blend of classic rock with a sprinkling of '30's 'scream' and it's got the perfect mix of camp at its heart. <br /><br />All three tracks are present: the 'Rockin' Bob Dylan cover (from his second solo album), the 'I Need Your Love' anthem, and the opening band performance. There's also a 'live stage' performance that is actually a classic for its day. The crowd just literally stands. Even then, the crowd is the star; it's the audience who keeps the pace moving in a wonderful homage to '69's' The Beatles.<br /><br />The whole movie itself is just an enjoyable way to spend an evening. The story was originally written for Lee's high school play, but was eventually turned into a feature film by Fox for the release in November of 1981. It was shot for a number of years in New York, but the production never saw the light of a theatrical release or was ever acknowledged by Fox. <br /><br />There's also a hilarious performance by Gene Levesque, who was one of the leading stage managers of the mid-60s and is one of my all time favorite characters. The movie was nominated for the Best Picture at Cannes last year, and it still has Levesque's usual smile and go-go gait. He was at the peak of his career before his tragic death tragically. <br /><br />I hope people remember Levesque's role in the screenplay, and perhaps appreciate the way it was directed for the audience. He was a true icon before he became a sad death at age 58, and I'll forever remember him as a rockin' hero. Go Blue! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Although a long film, I thought it well-made, with excellent direction and acting performances. It isn't quite Shakespeare -- no, it has a certain Shakespearean quality to it. The plot is a bit convoluted, but nothing in the way of too far-fetched. And this is a film that is not for everyone because it does have the elements that would make you sick. You will watch the ending coming so late in the film, that you'll feel it coming. I wouldn't make the mistake that I did of thinking that it was a comedy. I'm not saying that it's NOT funny, but you have to be prepared for what is really a sick and twisted plot. It also has a few \"A\" rated scenes, but you do have to think twice about seeing them. I would not recommend watching it. If you have to watch it, make sure you don't get freaked out by it. Overall, this was an interesting film -- although not Shakespeare-to-Feminine, I thought it was well-made and I enjoyed it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A couple who is vacationing in Mexico get a flat tire and later on find out, instead of some monster, that it is the wife being viciously murdered by her husband. Soon after, they discover that it is also the son of the killer while vacationing by accident...I think the movie was intended as a horror movie, and it is an entertaining one at that.There are quite some shocking scenes in the film, but I would like to think that it was really meant to be scary rather than a horror film.A well-made film, very well made with a strong story.I give this film a high rating. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"Shower\" is a very good satire of the soap world, and as such is a classic example of independent cinema at its best.This movie was made on a budget and is quite entertaining.The film is also funny and\n",

      " really thought of the idea of the film being about a serial killer killing his victims, but the characters didn't have enough lines of dialog to pull it off. A new serial killer is on the loose, but he's an old man with more experience than this group of guys. The film tries pretty hard to be terrifying and to keep things interesting while the new serial killer kills one girl after another. It just didn't work, and was a big letdown for me because it was supposed to be a horror movie, but ended up being nothing more than a cheap gore movie with the worst special effects ever seen.<br /><br />Also, the audio at first was quite bad and sometimes distorted. After watching the film I felt I was watching a bad horror movie, yet after a while I realized it had been a bad horror movie. It was just sloppy, so I guess I have to credit the cast for doing a good job with the script. It was very, very scary.<br /><br />Overall, just an average horror movie minus the suspense for the girls.<br /><br />3/10 _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ After seeing some of the reviews about the cast being unknown, how the movie progressed and what a stupid idea and a terrible screenplay this film actually is, in fact was a bad movie. The plot is really bad for a TV movie with a huge subject to be made. The actors are just very low grade, not even good enough to play schoolgirl type characters at all, just plain awful. It's a shame that the actors have not been given better pieces of work since this film, they have not been given better scripts, either. So what we have here are a bad script, a poorly filmed movie with a horrible script. I know it's not the end of the world to get such big names, but please, get something better. Don't waste your money. Not even making a good horror movie can you save the world from this sort of film making drivel, sorry. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ A great movie for any sci-fi/adventure junkie who likes the genre all around. You've gotta see this because I'm surprised no one else has seen it yet. <br /><br />I'm not sure why everyone else loves the film. It's kind of dark in that genre but I think people don't like it for the sci-fi. It's just so refreshing.<br /><br />Any movie that has John Lithgow, especially when playing an actor as powerful and deadly as he is in this movie will go over well.<br /><br />This movie was very good overall from beginning to end but I don't know why reviewers keep throwing it at other people as \"the best of the genre\". <br /><br />It was cool seeing Mark Hamill in this movie. I hope he makes a second (or more) feature out of this movie.<br /><br />Great movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The story of a woman who is wrongly accused of murder. After watching this movie you will know why she was guilty but her crime was not very big. Not only that but she acted like a slutty teenager who has a boyfriend that she's getting rid of. She just never seemed to be the victim, she just wanted to be in the world and do what everyone else was doing in the world had to do, to get in people's houses and rape them.<br /><br />The story was interesting - it started with a really good idea, then it evolved into an unbelievable cliché and finally morphed into a movie that really was just a bad movie in every imaginable way. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It was the most pathetic piece of drivel I have had the misfortune to see in years. I felt sorry for the producers as if they were out of money. This film was embarrassing and ridiculous. What the hell is wrong with it? Well I must say I would never buy anything from Netflix or Amazon, I don't have anything right now. I am truly sorry for not taking the time to buy it from the video store as it is too late! I would feel really cheated if they would give these two pieces of sh*t a copy because this film has to be possibly one of the worst ever put to film. I know this review sounds really harsh but seriously this film is a disgrace to any form of artistic integrity. It made me want to slap people in the face with an aluminum frying knife. Get out of the cinema! There is no point in wasting your time or money on this rubbish. Please, please do not watch this film. No one else is doing anything and nobody cares either... It is a disgrace. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I'll say it again--this is the worst film I have ever seen in my\n",

      " character and plot are just a shell. The music that plays in the opening scenes is the only reason for the show; but you better get used to it as it is utterly ridiculous on the face of it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie was not good. The casting was pretty off. I mean hey, the actor that plays Adam's dad in the movie plays that character great. But I was so disappointed by the movie. From what I was hearing, the writer's way of writing was pretty cool, but the movie's writing wasn't. The writer's weren't able to come up with any good lines to use for Adam. I was always thinking \"How would the person who is the protagonist of the movie have to act like Adam?\" Every time the writer tries to create a character that's not only cool, but is likable, I just found Adam to be boring and the movie wasn't going anywhere at all. For people to say they enjoyed it, please don't because I couldn't appreciate the movie the way I was watching it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Okay, I watched this movie and decided not to review it. It's good if you just want to know which movies that you can get a good laugh from when you get a job. If I could I would recommend this movie to anyone that wants to know how to get their hands on it. But I would also like to say that if anyone out here has a copy of this movie or is planning on seeing it if it may be worth the money. It's only the quality of the movie that matters, right there! I thought the story was funny and the characters were interesting. All in all I thought it was a really good movie. I would definitely recommend everyone to see this, even if you are a fan of John Lennon. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is more than just a movie, it is a collection of personal experiences. You go into the movie not knowing exactly what is going to happen and it is very natural that you want to stop and watch the movie to find out what happens next. I must agree with those people that don't like it for it has got the qualities of a soap opera with a lot of emotional scenes. The movie goes on like a drama from a soap opera. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ How many times have we all seen this movie? One time in a nightclub (in 1968). Two or three times at a houseboat auction (in 1999). Three times over Christmas when our families are alone--after all of the removals--during all of our holidays (I hope we all still are). And another time at a yacht club, when we have no money and are forced to watch this movie, and one time all the fun is gone because we have lost our houses because we can't pay the mortgage. The funny thing is that most of us don't want to hear about this movie at all; the rest only want to watch and talk about the movies that we don't want to watch. I think that the main source of the laughter came from the fact that we were all on the same boat (same owner and same boat manager). _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The movie itself is somewhat entertaining, but I didn't like how it was really written and directed; some of the scenes are just too long; the whole thing just sits there, not taking a whole lot of attention. It feels almost as if it didn't exist, and I could almost feel that sadness if I stared at its picture. It feels like all the actors (especially Mr. Bauchfeld) are going through a lot and getting nowhere. The characters all seem like losers, especially Mr. Bauchfeld, who at first seems the good guy, even though his character is so predictable. I don't like the concept of the writer writing such a movie; they must have thought that the movie must have been in their eyes the one that they watched, since there is hardly any interaction between the characters. The movie must have been done in 24hrs, before they thought it was a good idea to shoot it in France. The bad thing is: the bad screenplay, acting and direction were combined to make one mediocre effort; unfortunately I didn't laugh to anymore. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I just watched the latest episode of Buffy and I have to say, I couldn't have been more bored to death. It made me think \"Well, if that is so, it must be worse than anything a studio could produce\". I know I usually like this sort of thing, but this was just plain stupid, I wanted badly to wake up and find the television on and get involved with a show which is so unfathomably boring and dull. I only got involved with the show because I'm a big fan of Jennifer Love\n",

      " terms of the \"horror\" genre, but they had no intention of making the horror of war. The film takes all the trappings of war film to a great level. <br /><br />A great cast of actors play around with war's past to give the film a modern feel for it. But while they use it like it always is today, they do so in a fashion that does it a great disservice. The film starts in the middle of an action scene, and uses the story structure to tell a narrative that builds up in the past tense. Through it seems to be something important, though it isn't.<br /><br />The film is based on real events, which gives the story a somewhat unique flavour and character development. It works as a cautionary tale for the rest of the world, a warning for what would happen if they followed the path the film's characters had gone down, because it seems very clear what would go too far in the end.<br /><br />If you get the DVD, you can also buy the soundtrack as well, a mix that really captures the sense of the time and the people who played it. This is a great documentary that is, perhaps, too famous, but in the right context, it's a fascinating story. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I had high hopes for this movie, because it was a sequel to the well-regarded American Beauty. However, I expected more out of this movie since the American Beauty movie was not too well regarded in its genre, and for the budget they had to resort to a lot of close-ups and flash-forwards. Well, they did use close-ups and flash-forwards, and they couldn't even afford them! The only reason I gave this movie three out of ten stars instead of one is that I do think the movie was nicely done, the setting and the actors. Unfortunately, the story and cinematography are poor, and the film doesn't even come close to the original. * of 4 stars. <br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"O amamadô Filmas\", (\"The beauty of the stars\") _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ A young man, with a superlative physique and big muscles, decides to move to the countryside in order to work his extra muscle strength, and to take on some of the tougher fighters. The film starts slowly, since nothing much happens, and then gradually picks up pace. However, it's a little slow... the acting is stilted, and most of the action takes place outdoors, and in the field. The acting is mostly poor, with little emotion, passion or excitement. Only the first 5 minutes or so are very exciting and make an attempt to make the film interesting. The rest of the film has such a dull presentation, however it never looks like anything other than a typical action movie, made all the worse by weak direction. There's not much gore, and no nudity, either. The film has so much stupidity and stupidity, and you wonder where the money went, as the film barely keeps up the pretense that it's a film of the 70's. A lot of stupid actors like to act. At one point, a guy goes too far, and is killed. He looks like a 10 year old, so you see why he was killed in the first place. His big brother is in charge with the body, which means the body part isn't going to get the big break until later. In the end, the body is thrown. All this and a guy named Tintino (Lluis Johnson-Hauer) is the hero! What a twist, what a twist. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Just as in America's Past, the male characters are depicted and are portrayed as cowards for a start; and they continue to act like they still care what the females think of them in the future, whilst a female has been depicted as a buffoon at many points in the action.<br /><br />It's also good to see that not every male stereotype portrayed in the past has been crossed out.<br /><br />But the films shortcomings can be summed up in a few words. The film isn't exactly subtle in portraying that men only wanted women for a quick fix, and it's pretty blunt with it. But it doesn't seem like a very brave depiction of men and women.<br /><br />The way the film plays out, men think they're all bumbling fools who have no respect for women; and if anything, women are so oversexed, that they'll only ever see the good in a man, rather than an all-male group.<br /><br />Not that the film has any actual sex scenes, either. And they don't need any.<br /><br />The male stereotypes that make such cartoons as these a great series,\n",

      ", to name a few: In the 1980s, they tried a remake/renovation made by Steven Spielberg, and it never got rolling because of the interference, and therefore it didn't seem to have a good ending. In 2001 we get this in which the actors try to bring the characters back from the dead, and they all meet up with the \"resident\" (or were it 'out-resident'?) from their story. I thought this was a good (not very funny) ending, and it was the movie finally ending without a huge hiccup. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a terrible movie that I can't think of a single redeeming quality about it, and I really don't want to go on. It's such a horrible movie for the following reasons:<br /><br />Plot - Poor, predictable, weak. Characters - Undeserving. Plot - Undeserving. Dialogue - Undeserving. Characters - Undeserving. Plot - Undeserving.<br /><br />This is one of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen, or one of the most annoying movies I've ever had the displeasure of watching. There is not one single character in it that you care for. If there was one, it was ruined when you saw it. Just horrible. I guess if you decide not to watch it, you can have fun by making fun of every line of dialogue, every mistake you make at every turn....but even if you do that, you will feel so much pain for having wasted over 2 hours of your life. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a poor film. It has a bad script (unfortunately), bad actor and even bad direction. The main actor tries to show it but, unfortunately, doesn't act.<br /><br />There are very few films I was happy to see in the theater, where my friends and I watched the same movie a number of times. In this case, we all hated this film and decided not to see it again. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Although, this is not one of those movies, it's still a great family film if you're a family member. Just thinking about being a kid and seeing it over and over again, almost over and over is what I do with my family. It is what I have to say that I loved it so much (I guess I should be thankful that I'm doing this!). _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The original \"Sink me, I'm sinking\"-film remains a sensation, thanks not only to it's strong cast and hilarious final moments, but also the strong characterizations from all the players. But, even if you don't like the movie itself, \"St. Louis Pwnage\" is an entertaining and, dare I say, informative look into the underground punk music scene of Detroit. The songs here are some of the finest improvisational noise I've ever heard. \"The Boys are home,\" \"St. Louis Pwnage,\" \"Don't Stop Movin'\" and their \"No Exit\"/\"Fame\" anthem (if you could believe some of these lyrics) are a classic. It's great to see Steve Guttenberg and Michael Pitts on screen alongside fellow Detroit punkers, Cops and Crackers. This is the one and only time a cop will ever be called upon to perform his or her usual duty in a movie. And, I'm talking about that duty. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie is quite bad. The story doesn't go anywhere at all, especially the first five minutes. At first you think maybe the dialog is funny, the actors are very good and the screenplay isn't bad. But, when the actors start laughing, and the script completely fails...but you won't regret not watching it...or not enjoying the first five minutes of it. When I saw the trailer for this movie I was excited, I thought that with a few key mistakes and a strong directorial debuting from Luis Bunuel, I would have something much more entertaining. Well, Wrong. Nothing. Well, maybe one error in the translation of the title which was made worse by the title music. There was no translation of this title in Portuguese. If your in the right mood, I can't say anything else but don't waste your time...and for the sake of not wasting any more of your life....go watch a Spanish movie again! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ If you like Bollywood films then you must see this one of the best!! Boman Irani is truly the greatest director in Bollywood!! He has made some great films such as Dabnamodi, The Bird People (A.R.T.), and some other terrific ones like Ghoti Om, and his last film which he directed was Kaho\n",

You have to understand what you're looking for in a movie, so don't go to it expecting it for a few hours. go see this one, or if you're like 10, see it twice, you just have to put yourself in the right frame of mind if you want to stay entertained, and that's what i did. the best part of this movie i could say, is, just by the way you can see it all. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This film was a fantastic piece of film making that I would recommend to anyone or anyone that wants to get to know Broadway and appreciate some of the characters she does. This is just such a fun film. The first I ever heard the tune from the song \"In the Great Country of Your Heart\" I would call home and have the tune still playing in my head despite what life threw at me in the last year. I love the film. This is just a wonderful film. A true win for the performers. Go see it! Go see \"In the Great Country of Your Heart\" with the singers and see how it all ended up. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The film begins with a shot of a tree trunk snapping in twigs. Next it takes a close-up of an iris and from an angle. That's the beginning, that's a close-up shot that changes POV dramatically.<br /><br />Then it moves along a hillside into a valley with two people living in it. The husband has a dog with him, has a family, a dog whose owner seems to be struggling to keep the dog's owner, and a small dog himself who is getting a chance on his own. The wife seems to suffer from nightmares, and the husband finds out she's been possessed by a demon.<br /><br />They make a plan to help her, by sacrificing themselves. They want to take her dog, which they did. They want to make a house and new life and all they want is for their dog to come over. They want the dog to exorcise the demon.<br /><br />The wife is in a wheelchair, but the dog and wife are okay too. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was lucky enough to view this without the interference of the usual Hollywood movie fans. For the most part this movie was quite decent. The action is not as exciting to watch as the previous movie would be, but it is entertaining and worth watching. I am a little confused on where all the other reviews of this movie are coming from. I am sure they were written by fans who have not seen the movie, as well as a few others. Perhaps those will be more than able to identify with the story and actions of the heroine. While I enjoyed the movie, in my opinion, the director needed to take out the annoying music and scenes to ensure that the movie was not missed by any potential viewers. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is the only movie I have ever seen where the actors and actors and the plot are of a high calibre. In particular, the actors have all given performances which were worthy of great acclaim.<br /><br />The main characters are strong, especially the young (17) John G. Kennedy. This is one of my favourite movies.<br /><br />Bravo. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A must hear when you have insomnia -- this movie was it. It gave me that, and more. But the real reason I liked it was because it was so unusual, which is how often I can describe sleeping in without being able to explain it to anybody.<br /><br />The title says it all -- like a lot of movies which I have seen -- it's just that it wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, it was a total rip off of everything I had heard about the movie. I wouldn't have gone out and walked down to the library to have a look at it if I had known that this movie had been made. However, I have always been interested in movies -- in music and movies. It has been a while since I've seen a movie, but that's not because I don't want to like or enjoy the movies, it's because I'm interested in the music for it, and there are movies to watch.

And when one day, I find myself sitting in my dads seat, staring with my mind's eye, looking into his, thinking \"This could be that moment, huh? That could be,\" I was very excited... and it was. And I knew I was gonna love it... _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I haven't seen this for decades but it is the funniest film ever made that had such an effect on me. And this is the best example of the effect of the '70s on American cinema.<br /><br />The movie was the very first film that I'd seen that was good with sexual content but the '70s were also the best decade for American films. The '70s were a great decade for American cinema. The \"erotic thrillers\" that had come out during this decade, were the best ones as they got more of a plot to back them up and also the best ones on the comedy front; but if you ignore the hardcore erotic content, and concentrate on the story that moves the movie along, you really find a great movie.<br /><br />The actors here are all wonderful and very funny - especially when they are in this one. The movie has an original storyline and characters; however, there are many elements that are borrowed from other films and also are not as funny or as well developed.<br /><br />I only really have two complaints. One is the acting is definitely not high but for the guy who actually wrote the script, it probably wouldn't work without. The other one is the ending is a little bit long. When it comes to the ending, I thought that it just moved the audience along but the director did a good job of dragging the end of the movie along at the appropriate pace, but at some points, it feels slow. Nonetheless, I don't think it detracts from the overall quality of the movie, which is simply great.<br /><br />What this movie is, is a tribute to the great art that was being produced back in these days, so don't take it for whatever you believe that it really is. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This was a complete waste of time, considering it never has that \"sang\" to make it funny. All they do are scream their lines over and over.<br /><br />No one seemed to be able to hit their lines, and when they did there was no chemistry. It seems to me that they could be friends and all hit the same notes. (It was really boring). They didn't get down as much as they needed to.<br /><br />There was some nudity, but that was only to keep the viewers attention.<br /><br />Not worth wasting time on, and definitely not worth the price of a rental. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It wasn't as good as they were trying to make it out. It felt like the remake of \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and it didn't feel like a good remake at all. That one just came out. Now, I've seen many of the other movies on that show. This one tried to be special, but they're trying to be different and you feel that you're watching a re-make of a cheesy movie that tried to be great and try to be so special. It had lots of cheesy lines and even cheesy actors. I felt like it was not the remake of that movie.<br /><br />So I hope that it will just go back to where it belongs and I've seen it a lot better than this.<br /><br />4/10 _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I had the chance to see the movie again a few weeks ago and it still does not work. It is full of clichés and very low budget.<br /><br />Even the acting is so bad that it makes you sick. It is a movie for kids and should only be for adults. I found it really boring and there is absolutely no action. The whole idea of a super hero killing 3 demons 3 nuns was just stupid. The whole idea itself is stupid.<br /><br />The story is actually good i think. It has a bunch of good fighting scenes and not a minute with suspense or interesting or disturbing thoughts.<br /><br />The direction was terrible. I was hoping they would try another direction but they didn't. The director left on one hand tries to be funny or clever or clever but the end result is completely stupid.<br /><br />Also there is no action. I am not kidding. The actors only have 5 fights but with hardly 5 combat scenes they fight 3 demons. I am sorry but i think it's more realistic if they fight 4 demons at one time, you wouldn't get confused\n",

      " any, the film really is one of the most touching films ever made. It tells a story about the relationship that develops between a woman, a soldier, and a drug addict who both begin to have a common enemy, but at the end, they both find the love and happiness that they're looking for and that their lives will be complete without drugs or alcohol. Well, I've seen this movie many times over the years and it never fails to bring a tear to my eye. If you're looking for a happy life, this movie is the perfect choice. Overall, I highly recommend it! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Well I have seen this movie and I don't find it funny. The funny part is that this movie has nothing in common with REAL crime in NYC. This movie is just to cheap for that. No nudity, no good performances in the movie, and no fun to see. The funniest part is that I actually had to walk over to the subway to get home because the subway is miles away and I've worked out that the movie is at least 20 years old! LOL! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a good film about an American gangster who has been on the run for two decades. He has been taken into custody after he's captured at gunpoint and has to find a new way to kill people. The only problem is that his past is a mystery and the guards who put him in his place don't even look like they're in uniform - they aren't dressed like policemen! The only way to kill this guy is with the power of 3. The way they solve the mystery is well-known and I don't know what they were thinking of doing: there's no escape and no way out. But I think it was the same thing that I didn't like this story about an American who is trained to kill people. Maybe it's just that I didn't like this idea of a train that can take a guy across Canada, with its crazy weather and amazing scenery. I was looking forward to being able to say what this movie is about (I doubt most people will read this), but I never got around to seeing it and I'm glad that I didn't.<br /><br />If you like the \"Dead Man's Shoes\" or \"Death Tunnel\" by David Lynch (or other Lynch films), then the first thing you should do is see this film (and I believe that most people who enjoy this film will do so as well - even if you don't feel they're very original!). It's a bit strange to see what this movie has become. But, just like those films, this will be great movie entertainment. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The original of this is excellent but the sequel, although quite entertaining, never seems to have the audience with which to say something. When I first saw this movie, I was about 12, and my parents were a couple of times the size of my family. I can remember watching it over and over again as a kid, and when I first saw it in its original form. The kids were so drawn in to it and wanted to join in the adventure I couldn't imagine how ridiculous it would be. When I saw the sequel, I was 16. My biggest surprise, I found myself at that age even more entertained than I had been. I'm hoping to see it again soon, as I wish all the young actors did. I think the movie could become a classic without ever really thinking of the original, as it was way back when the original had only been out for a year or two, and I have the film memorized even with all the references made by my parents.<br /><br />I can't help but feel that the children watching this film are missing something that so many of them have - the ability to feel sympathy for other people. I had read so much about the first film, and I felt that it was only fair that I wouldn't be seen to hate anyone.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that I could find no mention of a second film. The original had many great references, but the sequel did not take time to find the new ones. I really would have liked to see a second film for the film, as it had many good qualities. I'm willing to guess that this sequel was not what people told me was the first.<br /><br />I also do not see how the sequel works on the other accounts. The movie was just awful, but I also hate this movie and never can see it as a failure, only as a waste of precious money and time. A year after doing the movie and having heard so much about it, I am sure I will find a replacement as a nice and cheap companion piece as the only reference was to the original, because I really can't imagine anyone who would miss it, and I'm sure that I would rather watch it again than\n",

      " a funny show, i recommend that all people check this movie out, it's so funny that i cant even believe i watched it. you could watch it over and over again and still get the same jokes. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This was probably one of the most disappointing films I have seen for the better part of a decade--it's not as if \"The Godfather Part III\" wasn't enjoyable but had a bit of a tragic ending that made it very darkly humorous, while the \"Shanghai Kiss\" bit was fun, but it's got to be on a lower rating. Not having watched the actual first two sequels (and I love horror, especially in the supernatural department), and knowing that nothing is guaranteed in that genre, I figured it couldn't get much worse.<br /><br />But it did. The first two sequels were fine, but the third instalment needed a bit of work, a bit of a make-up job on the whole (shadows on shadowing the girls is not a good idea unless it's done in a very '70s-style!), and an ending that seemed more rewarding than shocking. The new ending (which I think is just a make-up thing) is a tad too perfect and seems like a knock down, with all the twists and turns of the plot, to the point that it's very hard not to crack up at the end.<br /><br />Even so, at that, I don't think the story is quite good. I know that if it's not totally original and is really intended as a stand alone story, the film can be forgiven for it's flaws--it's not a classic like \"Tron\" or \"Scooby\" in any sense and feels very '80s in that way. The only thing I can say about this movie is that it has enough gore, and enough action and stupidity to justify a place amongst a pile of rubbish like \"The Curse of the Forty-Niner.\" _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The story may seem dated today, but it is a timeless one. The characters are similar to those of old,and the story line of that time is timeless. In today's world (and there are a lot of them), one can look at old horror films and be horrified by them, but in a sense, this movie is a warning about the stupidity of mankind. In old horror films, you can see people getting shot all over the place with shotguns, chainsaw wielding wannabes, and other guns. This film just shows people being beaten with bats, whips, swords, fists, and knives. This is the standard of the time.<br /><br />Yes, I said \"standard.\" It's that old. The kind of horror and violence that you see in horror films are the same old violence you see everyday in old movies. But, at the same time, this time is more real and more twisted, and this movie truly is unique. For those that are not familiar with the story, you should look out for the oldies, like \"The Handmaiden.\"<br /><br />I gave this movie a 10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I just couldn't take anymore. After nearly three hours of watching the original movie, I'm tired of sequels so bad they're just that. This movie was a good start. It went nowhere though, and I'll just have to admit I felt a little disappointed.<br /><br />I like how the director tried to make some sort of a plot out of a couple of teenage girl's sexual escapades. I don't wanna be grossed out though, but hey, I'm sure some people would enjoy it. But it's not a bad plot to follow.<br /><br />The characters don't really matter to me, the whole thing seemed like a piece of juvenile entertainment from a place in history where boys rule... And I get that. Maybe if I had a little more respect for the original cast, maybe this wouldn't have been such a pain to watch.<br /><br />I just think some people need to give this one a miss tho. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ <br /><br />This show, though it may boast some good acting, dull writing, and good direction, suffers the same fate as the proverbial bad episode of MST 3K.<br /><br />The title says it all. Not one single episode held much interest and the characters were completely one-dimensional.<br /><br />If the main character in the original film was supposed to turn to any other member of the cast, he would. This was because the entire premise they were using as background was completely removed.<br /><br />What the... I thought it was the MST3K team? _SENTIMENTS_\n",

      " as it was not the best film I have seen and never will be. I found most of the film boring as I said it was boring very easily not fun as I have already mentioned there is not much to say. If your looking for a good drama see it not a film for drama film fans. Overall 4.9/10 _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ When a girl who looks like her and sounds like her brother, an old man who claims to be a priest, then it's pretty much a safe bet that some horrible horrible supernatural event will occur. So, to escape being raped while walking home, the helpless girl and her brother go and try to make their way to a nearby town. While at the library, the woman has to guess if she can get the men who attacked her brother to reveal who did it, which is quite a task. Not as scary or tense as other B-movies, though the ending does provide some gratuitous sex scenes. I was expecting a bit of a rape fest as it was only a PG, but for the most part the movie was just a harmless rape fest. The acting is okay, nothing special, but at least the movie did have some interesting gore. This movie was pretty low on the budget so I'm glad it was not, but this could have been a lot better. Don't see it, but if you can get past this it may be fun. Also worth noting is that I haven't seen the first part 3 (which I consider a waste of film). _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ After viewing the film and noting its many shortcomings, I just can't help but wonder if this movie's producer was even aware of the fact that the film will not, by any stretch of the imagination, deserve any kind of honorable mention. It's a very boring movie and a particularly bad film that I have seen so nothing even remotely interesting (or worthwhile) that I just couldn't bear to watch it all the way through. My opinion that Christopher Lindsay was a great film actor who had amazing potential and who deserves all the respect that he has received simply because his name is in the credits is equally as meaningless as his performance in this film. Lindsay doesn't carry the movie. As for the cast - let me repeat, there is not one bright moment in this film which any one has the nerve to call \"original,\" and they seem to be just doing their best to avoid that very tag. There has been an excellent film made by a brilliant director. There hasn't been an extremely bad movie made by this master of bad movies. The only one comparable to this stinker is Paul Verhoeven's THE WOODS OF LUPINIA. Although this film may be low on budget, it is an excellent movie. This alone doesn't warrant the cast members in acting in such a dismal production. They either know that this is a bad movie or they do not even try to conceal that, from the opening sequences, they do not intend to make it any better. The result is a movie that is so bad that it actually makes one regret that they have spent a dime on it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ If I'm being honest, I don't get this movie very often. It's pretty low on the budget scale, and I can understand if it was made for $5.00, but it could have been made better by using a different production company...or by spending the extra night in the studio and doing a little film school.<br /><br />This movie follows the standard formula of a movie based around a man who just wants to have sex with a girl, and he fails...no he doesn't get his girl, so he can't win her heart. It would have made this sort of film far scarier. <br /><br />For me the special effect are a joke. I've watched this a couple of times with friends and it's always the same thing. The guy holds a gun to a guy's head and he fires his gun a few rounds. The guy shoots a few rounds in the crowd for no reason at the end.<br /><br />The story line about the doctor is interesting when it happens, but it just never gets out into the flow of the film.<br /><br />The movie is almost like a short film version of the movie \"Blow Out,\" and that's funny. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The main reason I didn't give a zero is because all the problems with the animation and the writing are not the usual things that can be expected of a short film. This is NOT a movie that will entertain you! It is not a story. I am a movie fan and I've seen many short films, but not this many! The voice work is horrible. The \"bad boys\" sound so bad on some synthesizer that it almost seems ridiculous. The singing and\n",

      " and with that one of the movie doesn't make it. I don't recommend this movie please. Just watch \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" instead please. And if you like bad movies make your own movie please. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a really bad movie.. I mean a so bad that it's good kind of way.. We've seen it a thousand times and most of the time its just a terrible mixup of people doing things in order to do nothing or other people trying to do things to do things... and it just gets even worse from there. It's like there's a big \"D\" on the end of everyone's name and this would be an okay movie in order to put a little more \"shame\" on this... but unfortunately this gets bad really fast.. and really badly..<br /><br />Well if you like bad movie's then there's this movie (no there's a film there is).. I got this in a DVD set called \"The Bangerty Birds\" it comes with a bunch of really bad looking people doing bad acting.. It's a pretty bad movie (not bad enough to be good) but there's a lot of people wearing clothes you wouldn't see at a party wearing them on here.. but that the funny because the \"acting\" people have to look out for themselves..<br /><br />Anyway there's a bunch more of bad actors with bad looks doing stupid things as we go. There's some funny stuff in there and most of the time.. you can't see much other things happening.. you just can't because they have too much scenes.. so there's lots of people doing stuff that looks stupid even if its not.. which the bad acting people have too to hide behind..<br /><br />Its not a terribly good movie but its funny for a funny reason. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I watched the original, and the new, but this movie had so many things wrong. First, it was so boring. I was at work all day on the second week. I was at work for a full hour trying to finish the novel, and the only time I could turn it around to see what was happening the the real horror of the house where they were held was in the second set. They were talking in a language that I never heard of, a language that at no point did they understand. They were just saying out orders and being ready for these orders to come, which didn't seem to fit my interpretation at all. And the main problem with the new movie is that it goes way into the past with no explanations for it. It doesn't seem as if the old movie was filmed at all, because the editing and set are totally different, and don't fit with the rest of the new stuff. The scenes go into the past a few times too quickly, and if you watch it for some part of the movie, you get all the old shots out on your own with no explanation. I don't normally go into movies like this, but I felt compelled to write a review about this one. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ From the beginning of this movie you expect to be treated to hilarious stuff (but not in the \"I laughed so hard that my eyeballs hurt\" kind of way, believe me, this movie is well below \"serious\" status). There is lots of talent in this flick(especially the \"stars\") and the actors do a good job of showing their talents, although the \"acting\" is a little over the top(at least when I laughed at least once). The film also uses all kinds of weird and weird looking weird toys(like the guy who is always on \"Eddie & Friends\")some of them seem to have hidden meanings(yes, I'll explain in the future), but if you can stick with it, as I did, you can have yourself a very entertaining movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The movie begins in a remote area of the Russian Federation and tells of an expedition headed by Lieutenant Vladimir 'Vadmir' Karamzin who takes one person to investigate a legend about a Russian ghost town. Two other people join the group to complete the mission.<br /><br />'Talladega Nights' starts out relatively well as a normal life movie. An American scientist, Dr. Ivan Pavlovi, arrives in a time capsule and begins to explore the ruins of what is supposed to be the most visited town in Russia. There are no other casualties and apparently only one dead tourist who dies of a natural causes. The film begins to take a downward turn towards the end and then begins to lose pace as the film becomes increasingly boring.<br /><br />The film has some funny scenes but also some less funny ones, such as Pavlovi uniting the two people(perhaps one of the more shocking moments in the\n",

      " at all, this one looks like some poor man's remake of the original version of \"The Searchers\". Sure, there are better movies, like \"Red Eye\", to check for plot holes and the general dumbness of acting, but if you want to see some fun and some fun scenes, go and check out this film! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It's hard to believe that a movie so great (well, maybe because I grew up in it) as `L'Ozone'? was released in 1965. Although the plot is absolutely cliché, i don't think there is another film like it. <br /><br />It's about a world champion cyclist, and that is why he is on the racetracks for many races. To keep his mind busy he becomes a detective in a hotel which also happens to be the place where an assassin lives in this time-space continuum. He is obsessed with winning a race during his lifetime, that is why he was so shocked when he had to leave the racetrack. <br /><br />It's about a very innocent girl, and she was the only thing of interest in the film. That was the only thing that made me want to change the channel. <br /><br />And it's a great movie for only kids because they won't get bored because of the constant action and the suspense. <br /><br />I give it a 10 of 10 because it is a great film. My 11-year-old liked it, but my mom did not. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A movie like this doesn't need to have any great actors to make it good. It can be a great movie if the writing, direction, and acting is just spot on. The first two episodes are so much fun to watch that you cant help but watch the third, as well as the next two episodes. I was really looking forward to a film like this one, because it just got to be one of the best thrillers the last couple of years. That being said, let me be honest: the movie didn't exactly live up to my expectations. There is a very simple plot about a young woman who gets involved with a corrupt drug dealing father, and the tension of that situation is too much for me (in my opinion). Then there was the problem of the movie being too slow, with no real character development. What really made it hard for me to watch in this movie was the script. It just seemed like an edited, thrown together mess to me. The story just wasn't there, and I couldn't really care about the characters, for the first half of the film. The last two episodes were so intense that made you want to see the end, otherwise I would have been more happy having just turned it off.<br /><br />The actors really pulled it through as you expect them to, especially with the two leads who were so promising in their roles. But when it was over I would have really been sick for this. It seemed as if the filmmakers put too much work into it, and the result is a stupefying mess. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I just watched this documentary for the second time today--I found it to be a very enjoyable and thought-provoking story.<br /><br />The subject, the Diasos (the \"white devil\" - the term used by the author), was the mythological counterpart to the modern-day \"white-trash\" -- an insidious, evil force that has corrupted, destroyed, and in some instances destroyed white people. This same force has been blamed for the extinction of the white race through a \"demise\" of European civilization. While this may be true, this is not the only possible explanation for the \"white devil\".<br /><br />To understand the movie and its main point of view you would have to spend some time reading a book by Neil Young. This is the only book that has an inside-inside-views feature. <br /><br />The director and editor made this video book available in a hardback edition (VHS) on their website so that those who can't see it in \"transmedia\" stores could at least get the idea of what they are up against in the story. You would not be disappointed. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Like The Grudge series, this film was very much like a \"Twin Peaks\" episode with ghosts...only with killer zombies. Both Twin Peaks and this film were really brilliant! With the two leading characters being psychic stalkers on the prowl for the perfect prey, with this film the director has pulled of the entire subject to create a very cerebral thriller/adventure that is brilliant in every sense and has a brilliant cast which includes a fantastic array of talent including Richard Parsons as Ray, as well as Tim Blake Nelson playing\n",

      " to have had little involvement in the production was a bit intimidating.<br /><br />Overall it's a well-made movie that is a good idea for a small budget production. At the very least, I like the fact that these guys aren't some generic young actors with no real experience and their acting is quite believable, even for someone who hasn't seen enough of them.<br /><br />In short, this movie is for fans of action and the kind of stuff that these guys do for fun. As someone who likes his Bond movies a lot, I like the setting in this movie. As someone who is only into action, I dislike the plot. I hate a movie that has no real plot. And it bothers me that action films are the top priority so bad.<br /><br />For this reason alone, I give this one a 7/10. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw this film recently and I found it very interesting. It was a short film so I was hooked from the start. The actors were great, the plot was interesting and I'm used to American films. Overall it was a GREAT film that I would recommend. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The best thing about this movie is that it shows the real face of drug addiction. I did not see it when it came out initially and I am now a huge fan. I find it more realistic and realistic than the latest \"Grindracker\" (I really DO not understand their love/hate relationship.) The actors and the plot are great in this movie. You really root for the main characters, and it gives you great entertainment. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie is not for everyone. It is a bit slow and there are a few clichés. But people with high libido, strong sexual desires, and no sense of ethics should go see this movie. It will give them a chance to examine their libidos.<br /><br />The story follows 2 young college girls. The first is \"Cinderella\", the second is \"Fembot\". The plot and acting are terrible but they don't know what else to do with an hour of screen time. The soundtrack is horrible and it does not help that the characters spend the majority of the movie playing games or getting in trouble. These people are out to get and they are willing to go where anyone in the society may look to go.<br /><br />There is nothing redeemable about this movie. If you are at all interested in seeing this movie, wait for this movie to come to the big screen in a movie theater. If you are a high school science teacher, wait for this movie to come to the big screen in a library; if you are a high school science teacher let your students know about this horrible movie; be explicit with them and the students; make them ashamed of their libido with games or drink alcohol. People who actually want to go to the movies to see this should not go.<br /><br />My rating: 0 (2 out of 10) _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I couldn't stand this awful sequel and I could only tolerate it with my friends. This was the first movie that I hated and I still don't mind watching sequels like \"Hurt\" and these two \"Fool For Love\". The second movie, this isn't bad either. At no point at all do I see the likes of \"Boyz n the hood\" or \"Fool for Love\". These movies have nothing like the original \"Fool For Love\". None. Not only the soundtrack, they have the story, the dancing, the costumes, the scenery, the sets and most of all the make-up. The make up really gave me a headache and the make up person who was in this movie wore a Paula Wilcox-esque wig with one eye, a bad one. They even had the worst make up in their casts. But I understand they didn't really have enough money to go all out for a proper movie. They were able to keep it for a limited time which just makes it all the better, I suppose. I really enjoyed the first movie \"Hurt\" and then started hating on this one. I can't believe I wasted $8.25 on this one, I'll give it a 4 out of 10. I'll just stay with my 2 favorites, \"Fool For Love\" and \"Boyz n the hood\". 1/10 _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I first saw this movie in the theatre at a free advanced screening for people who were going to see a horror film. It made me want to see horror films in the theater and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Hilda Boniface was fantastic in this portrayal of a seductress with a bad rep as a writer.<br /><br />\n",

The film is a beautiful visual narrative, beautifully crafted and the camera-work is breathtaking. <br /><br />The film has a sense of loneliness - the characters exist in a haze - even the camera works in this setting which draws you in to the story, much like an 'in-between-airplane'-type setting.<br /><br />There are a few things that annoyed me about the movie - the first is the idea that they are just going through a process of 'evolution'. What does that mean? Why can't we be 'emotionally aware' beings and just go through the process of evolving ourselves? I thought the film had a more 'humanistic' touch which wasn't so often used in this type of film.<br /><br />The second thing that annoys me about this film is the way the main characters are made out as weak and helpless victims.<br /><br />The final point that has been hit in this film is the main themes - the 'good/bad' and 'un-caribbean'- sub-tends of the world. Why can't we be ourselves and just accept the whole 'world' that exists beyond our biological bodies - I think that is what the main protagonists are.<br /><br />Overall 'Incoherent' is a story that i think we can all watch and understand. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I don't like the word \"drama\" and I don't hate drama, but after seeing this movie, I couldn't wait to see it again.<br /><br />The plot is a little hard (as any good horror movie must be), and some scenes felt long. I mean, a kid that is supposed to live happily with his grandparents in Switzerland? How does he live with the people in this town? His girlfriend/spouse? His brother/mother? My sister, her name is Sandra? You can't live with that in every life.<br /><br />The actors were good. I would have to give this movie a 7, but I still don't want to say a negative number...they have to work in one of the few movies in the U.S. that I enjoyed. One of those that could have been a hit.<br /><br />I think we have all seen a horror movie that is as similar to this as The Blair Witch. I know that there are people in \"Citizen Kane\" like a true story and I have seen many people that have an interesting, but they live with their bad. They are still kids, and they have to work, sometimes very hard...for that in this movie. It has a little bit of the \"B\" movie - not the \"B\" genre, but it really has some \"b\" elements.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone (as long as they can stand the good horror in life). _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ If you like rock music, this is the DVD for you. It's the perfect late night read for the music, and it makes the classic songs and song perfectly fit for a late night binge that doesn't want to miss something at the expense of your brain cells it is. And if you are having trouble sleeping I know the movie will make you sleep on the floor! <br /><br />It also features the most amazing musicians of rock at their point in time, that is what you want to see. The band \"Lefla Oe\" is one of the coolest bands of rock music since the 80's. It features a diverse band and cast that includes some of the best rock musicians of their time in the past 20 years! <br /><br />I believe this is one the top 90 movies out there to watch. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I had never even heard of John Leguzaimo before I started watching this at his new film, The Unseen Rider. I wasn't completely unfamiliar with his work, but I had never seen him on the screen. I found his acting and characters to be fascinating, and I am glad I did not need the film of The Haunted Rider to get to know him. He is well-traveled and extremely well-written, and, all in all, a story of human suffering that is incredibly well crafted. It was as much a pleasure to watch this film as it was to watch. I don't know if I will ever find someone who can make me laugh so much. He knows how to make a \"spooky\" experience, and I have definitely found that this was exactly the right choice; I'm not certain my girlfriend would\n",

      " it that it does a good job at it's job: it gives a hint of what's to be hoped for in a film and it does a good job of creating a mood. Not always a popular opinion, but i think it was a great debut. I hope it does good business in the USA. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am not a fan of the \"X-Files\" TV series, but there have always been show episodes that I did not get a chance to watch because they were not that good (or not shown at a drive-in theater), or they were not what I was expecting with my DVD. There were a few times I was able to watch these but there were times I would not be able to sit through it, so I was more than a little disappointed.<br /><br />This episode was not so much disappointing, but quite frankly a bit of a bore and I did not like most of the acting. I mean this was a pilot for a TV-series for the X-Files so I have not seen all of them available (at least not in the 1st season), but I am wondering if the producers really thought they had something here on a small level (the characters were somewhat likable) to offer their viewers. I also thought the episode was rather bizarre as it was not at all what I thought it would be. Again, not a bad episode, but I was disappointed that this had not been released on DVD.<br /><br />The plot involves the daughter of one of the central characters being involved in some sort of conspiracy that includes human experimentation and even a scientist trying to bring their technology to bear against something that they believe is a threat to their genetic heritage and/or their way of life. There is not much plot depth here as the plot does not build up to a point with that in mind and I do hope they had a little more to work with (but I think what they showed in this episode was enough to make up for the lack in plot depth and acting). Nevertheless, this was not really a bad episode by the way. The acting did get a little stiff at times, and the overall tone was a bit darker (especially the end sequence and the beginning of each episode). Overall, the experience did serve its purpose if it was not in my opinion the X-Files' best. There are far more good episodes of the series and just not all that well done. However, they still do stand out and do put out a number of my favorite episodes.<br /><br />7/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I never seen this movie but I must describe it myself. I didn't see it theatrically. I did see it on Video. It's one of the most original and amazing movies I have ever seen in my life. It really is that good. I believe it is the best movie of it's type ever made that can be enjoyed by all the people. So if you have not seen this movie - don't be afraid of it. The movie is a little old now but I still remember it the first time. The cinematography is so awesome. The music is so amazing. The acting is so good. And the \"acting\". I don't really know what they said at the end but I hope that it got caught on the tape when it was released on TV. I thought it did and it kept going back to how the movie ends and how it had almost \"finished\". I hope that I see it again as I have seen it over and over(the whole time I saw it theatrically I was fast reading the subtitles and that's how I knew that I knew so many moments of the movie). I have this in my collection now on video with so many times over the years. I just got it and after I watch it, I just think that I must watch it again (it's the most amazing movie of this I have ever seen in my life) and it will be my greatest work yet. It truly is a masterpiece by the very few people who make a movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I rented this movie expecting a low high B-movie. I was seriously surprised and entertained by this movie, but not in enough to make a meaningful review. If you don't know the background of the story, stay away from this film at all costs. I have an urge to shoot someone. It's that funny. Not that it has anything to do with \"Hot Shots\" or \"Dallas\". This story is not as original as those two greats or even \"Dallas\". It is a fairly interesting story, and was interesting at first viewing but once it started becoming bogged down and you were bored with it, you probably couldn't take any more. To sum up, this has to be the worst film I've ever seen in my entire life. You'd think a movie like \"Hot Shots\" or even\n",

      " in the end). I was very interested to learn more about this film. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Like all great art, it is about taste and the choices we make but also about the limits we draw upon and the limits we ignore. The question, then, becomes not \"What is a good film?\", but \"What is a good film?\", as the director chose to ignore any and all common sense and merely leave the viewer with a plethora of images and sounds and, ultimately, a story. He wanted this work to be shot in a single day, so he set up a number of camera tricks that would allow him not to have to be fully present with the actors. In the middle of the film, he would be free to concentrate on the scenes that his camera was trained to show, each one more baffling than the last. There's really not much more that I need to say, except that it is very much a short film and will be difficult for any viewer to sustain 90 minutes of it without missing anything. It is a film with several interconnecting stories--some amusing, some not, all with a certain distinctive style all its own. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The last part of the \"Dukes\" trilogy was quite good, but pretty much the whole plot was forgotten about. I missed one of the \"Dukes\" pilot episodes shown in June of 2005.<br /><br />\"Bad War\" is just as bad. Complete waste of time for the Star Trek Trek fans and a complete failure for Gene Roddenberry. I mean, Roddenberry is a visionary and made many things such as the \"Star Trek\" TV series possible. When, they say there is \"no limit\" to things that can be done on a small budget, they are forgetting that one or two times (e.g. Roddenberry created \"Cinema Paradiso\") was too many for a television series of even a few thousand. And I can see why. How many movies can be made on a tight budget with the same sort of success? Well, \"Dukes\" exceeded that limit in every way imaginable. I mean, I wanted it to go better, but it just couldn't. I mean the actors were wooden, wooden, wooden--good things could only go so far. I wanted to see Johny Diaz in something better, but there was absolutely nothing to see other than some plastic statue who was a prop for the plot. I was also very, very disappointed that this part of the story had been completely forgotten. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a very good documentary. I am quite amazed at all the views on this film here on IMDb. It has a lot of great footage of the world of art and music as well as people who live in a lot of art galleries and some art houses and work in a lot of the world's biggest music companies. I think this is an outstanding and very entertaining documentary. It is the best documentary of the last decade. It will make you think a lot about your own cultural heritage and how people think and act in relation to it. I agree with some comments made by the previous reviewer when he said that the subject matter could very well have been a fictional story, but at the same time, it is a very real and very honest portrait of how people live their artistic lives. This is a great feature film and a nice way of seeing the world of art from the eyes of a real painter. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a rather slow-moving film, yet the author clearly has something to say about life and death, and it isn't so preachy as to be annoying. Instead, he just plays around with ideas and takes us on a little journey. And on the way he shows us images from his favorite (and favorite actress) in \"American Choir.\"<br /><br />Of course it is important to note that \"Death\" is in no way a portrait of the life of a real person. The author is a fiction, and for that reason we should give it much leeway. <br /><br />I give it 7 out of 10, and am glad I watched it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ One of the oddest films I have seen in a long while - it was so different from anything else i'd seen and had a good cast including a great script - and it was so bizarre! It's like a mix of a short from \"Deathbed\", David Cronenberg's \"Suburbia\", and Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\". The actors do a very good job with what they are given and all in all it's worth a watch (or two!) _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Like most, I loved \"Naked Gun,\" but I hated \"The Hitcher\n",

      " getting a hard to handle job that requires you to do not only on location filming but also on location acting. That is the biggest criticism I have about this movie.<br /><br />In fact, I found this movie to be a lot of fun for the whole family. There are so many funny scenes and characters that make the movie laugh for me. For example, I was laughing all the time when I was filming the scenes of a woman running on the screen. Another funny scene is where Jim and Annabela sing at a radio station. But more funny scenes are with people they find in other movies not in this movie. For example, where Jim and Annabela sing on a train (I always forget to mention that!). Also when Jim sings in the scene of an old guy singing (You can tell he was just in improv!). And of course there is the big love scene in the end! All of this is well worth watching! It is a very funny movie and probably everyone will get a big laugh out of it. It is a movie that will make you smile! Maybe people won't even be able to enjoy it as much as they are used to seeing animated movies because of a lot of \"gore\", but hey, it is a movie with laughs and will make you smile!<br /><br />Yes! \"Pixar!\" does contain a few \"funniest\" scenes, but it was fun also watching things that I never could understand, or at least they weren't funny to me. In addition, this movie has lots of laughs and just makes you laugh like no-one else! This movie is great and it is a great family movie to watch! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I have seen all sorts of Sci-Chrome, but this one really blew. The plot was nothing short then a bad soap opera. The characters were even worse. It was hard to watch, especially as I didn't find anything remotely interesting about it.<br /><br />A major waste of time, and another huge mistake. I can't believe they even tried to release this in Australia. As it would only be a TV movie, not a movie on the big screen! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This should have won awards in the UK and the USA. But, they must have overlooked the fact that the film does not really work. There is a huge amount of unnecessary music that had absolutely nothing to do with the film. And it looks very amateurish to boot. And it is a shame too, since this film was made to educate film students about what acting and film-making really is and can be. But this doesn't mean that it should not work, it just means that if you do try your hand at film-making and can't then at least try your best, then make sure that you do not spend your time and money on this a waste of time. If I did this film then, if it had been a television show I would have had to call a halt to my career. Yes, the film is visually very good but there is no true story here! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have loved this show since 6 years of watching it with my sisters. At first it was slow. They used slow pace. I think it got a little better every year, but I always found it a little harder then ever before.<br /><br />To date it is still entertaining. It is a bit long for my older brothers, but it is very enjoyable for my younger one. I think the movie is good in its cast. I think it is a good idea to put the people who read the book first. Also, the author, G. C. Scott is the perfect choice! I hope it will be on for a lot longer!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ There have been some good reviews of \"The Piano Teacher\" for its performances, but it is a stinker.<br /><br />I won't give a negative rating, but this film was NOT funny. It was not imaginative, nor memorable. It was boring and not interesting at all.<br /><br />The plot is predictable (the scene when Gerta visits the funeral for her father...really, how do predictable plots become suspenseful?), the directing was poor and the actors did not stand out very much. I would not recommend this film to anyone - NOT even for an 8 year old who hasn't seen the film before.<br /><br />What a horrible waste of time. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie today through one of those local movies/night movies (you know, guys where they take a small, small risk taking picture and the reward is big). As far as I could see, it was a great film. For what the f*** did they do?! I was looking\n",

      " - this is one of those movies where the only people who should know it, should have paid to see it. You can find it. I'm sorry. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a great film and the best movie of the 1970's. I know, some people have called it corny and derivative from other films.<br /><br />Well, the plot is a little different. This is NOT a remake and it is a bit different to other movies, for one. What makes this different is that the story, the story is timeless and we need to stop to be led down that same path. That is what this comes across as in a lot of the film.<br /><br />The acting by the main cast is also very good and believable as well as the storyline. The movie is also very original because there are no special effects to speak of, this was made in the '60's. They just used film stock and other effects which adds credibility to the story and makes it feel more real. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Like some other people on here this movie is like the ultimate version of \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World\". If you're into these type of films you will love this one as it contains a lot of humour and a really funny (some might say not so funny) director as well! The cast for this film has a plethora of funny people in it including some very quotable comedians. This is one of those movies you will have with a group of friends and it doesn't matter what the genre, language or even the technicalities are, you will still be laughing and smiling and it IS THAT funny. If a comedy is made on this scale the movies themselves do not make any difference and all can be hailed as great entertainment. The ending is slightly disappointing but that can just about put you through the watching of the film but its the best out of the three in terms of entertainment value. I really am just thankful i didn't pay to rent it on VHS, i did catch the movie on one of those classic Friday nights as an added bonus. Overall, a definite 7/10!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was fortunate enough to just recently pick up this copy of this movie and as I've only ever seen a few of the Disney films based on the original book, it sounded like a good movie. That's until i looked at the script and immediately it was bad. I was so bored throughout the movie and couldn't understand what was going on and the dialog was stupid and not funny, the plot was completely bad and pointless and Disney wasn't even bothering to follow the book! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw the last of the great Samuel Jackson films and am now in the process of watching the rest. This is one of the very best. A must see for any Jackson fan. A must see for anyone who ever wanted to make a movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am a huge fan of H. G. Wells and am very familiar with the many adaptations of his works. I also love to create fan fiction.<br /><br />However, I never believed this film was even close to his master work.<br /><br />I saw the film on a very early, unseasonal, independent basis. I have all the books and seen the director's cut, but my conclusion is that this would still be better.<br /><br />I agree with Peter Piper regarding the actors. Most of them were decent, but Robert Carlyle and John Phillip Law were just too aged, and this would have been a more interesting character and story. Even with those flaws, they had what I would have expected from a fairly bad production. (I also considered putting him in the role of the young, as played by Jack Lemmon, but I never really got much of a chance to do that)<br /><br />Still, the performances as the main characters is very good and the story was more interesting than the first half-hour. There were some scenes that were just silly or over-gloriously over-done (the love scenes and the \"unfaithful wife\" scene), but I was glad to see all that was left of the great characters at the end. I also thought that \"The village idiot\" was a really nice character and could have been really funny. It was certainly a looker in the dark when he came in, but as the evening wore on, it began to dawn on me that he was really just a very awkward man with nothing good to do and no interest in people. <br /><br />Still, the story is still very good and it was interesting how some of the characters became what they eventually became, which I can't give away, as it was never entirely the focus of the story.<br /\n",

      " nominal. The last thing we need is the plot having been the same.<br /><br />The film is nothing special, and if it was going to be a comedy I would have done better, but because it was a drama only received three points. In fact it was a very well done drama with good acting all round.<br /><br />Watch it if you haven't already - you won't be sorry. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I didn't make the time to watch this \"film,\" but on the other hand I was able to watch it because, as an aspiring writer of musical comedy, I'm really curious about the \"soul\" of the performers. A lot of times, singers and musicians, who really become \"talented\" in the last 5 to 10 years of the music/cinematography industry, can make an \"interesting\" film if a fair amount of research and hard work goes into putting it together, as this was an opportunity to do just that. If done flawlessly, the film could be an actual masterpiece if done properly (as seen when the performances are not edited with cringeworthy, violent gratuitous profanity--such as in \"I've Only Just Begun\"). But because the film is apparently an OVA, the creators felt the need to \"cleanse\" it by way of cutting the songs and having it re-sued. Instead of the \"naturalness\" naturalness that seems to characterize EDM, this film is a very glossy, Hollywood superficial \"comedy.\" The director seems to have had an agenda of destroying these performances from the beginning (and he has many), while the performers have to endure not only being able to give him their best, but some of the worst, acting they have ever faced. It's not even funny--it's painful to watch! Some of the performances aren't even believable. The film is obviously low-budget and filmed to look professional. But that isn't a bad thing, and sometimes it even works for a film that tries to be clever while making the most of its low-budget nature. I have seen worse, but this one really is worth watching just to see what I can get for the $$ spent on it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I rented this movie because I like Cillian Murphy (Gilligan) and Largo Winling (Mervyn Walsh) . I thought that the idea of a war breaking out amongst the civilians seemed to be a great idea. I was hoping that this would be a great opportunity with Largo Winling saying \"Gilligan, stop worrying. I can handle this little boy with a rag-tag Army unit.\" and a lot more. So I was looking forward to this movie. I was prepared for a cheesy and violent one. I thought it would be a nice romantic love triangle and one of those great romantic stories. But this is nothing! The script is terrible, the storyline is bad, the acting is terrible (with the exception of Largo Winling), the music is crap, and the characters are clichéd. I am very surprised that someone rated this film as a 10! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie was a perfect movie for me because as a kid i was always told this movie would cure cancer, and many times. It made me laugh and made me cry and made me want to cry. This movie had so much magic and had a great feeling to it i remember it sometimes being on late at night when the little kids were playing in the garden and there was a witch ghost walking through the yard. <br /><br />You could tell when there was a movie coming as you knew it wasn't going to end up a good movie but it always seemed to be a perfect one. Not only would I get a kick out of when they took a dime at the beginning or there was a joke they made a bit of twist at the end. The movie also had the feel of when it was over you were sad you had gone through so many times with that same dream you had just the very beginning of a movie. In a way you always felt a sense of what you would be with a certain moment in life with that little twist and it was just what you needed. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a film that tries to tell you exactly what to expect from life in the late 70's and what to ignore in order to have a good time. Sure the characters are cliché, the plot has been done, and the general tone of the whole movie is cheesy, but hey! What does it make for a fun, enjoyable and entertaining movie? That the acting is superb, the special effects are really beautiful, and the cinematography is amazing. The film does it's best to make you feel good, and it really does.

      " and and the \"wonderful\" music, as is the story, is the reason why I am a great fan of this TV series.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In our post WW2 world, \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" proved to be a top-notch romantic comedy. It was a breath of fresh air to have this charming ball of film-making soap opera romance wrapped up with some serious comedic chops.<br /><br />Robert Englund, a terrific comic actor, provides the occasional comic relief to this script. The two lead characters, Albert Brooks (who provides a more sympathetic and believable Dr. Jekyll than in most of his other roles) and David Hyde Pierce, do a fantastic job of adding the sparkle and life to these otherwise thoroughly dreary role roles.<br /><br />The Dr. Zohar characters add to the appeal of the story. The two \"superior\" thugs in the story, played by Englund and the always terrific Scott Sterling as the title character, are a joy to see on screen. The fun and gags throughout supply lots of laughs, and that's part of the fun of this film. There is plenty to pass a funny mood into, plus there's plenty of comic conflict and lots of fun for the characters and camera operators.<br /><br />Soap is a wonderful film to watch in the sunny afternoon. Maybe one day it will find a much larger and better audience, though we are certainly in a new film resurgence. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If you are into music and the bands of that era, you will find a lot to like. But you need to watch some stuff before this movie's over. I've seen the MRC tape and the original promo video, but there is really no music during those segments. If you need more of that music, see the Beatles. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The thing is, what we have here is a good, solid example of a short that should be seen by a broad range of audiences and seen as more than a snapshot. We all recognize the flaws, and the production has a number of flaws too, but this is a short best seen as a snapshot. It's a good snapshot, it really is.<br /><br />The opening shots set our characters in their era and we follow them through the short with such scenes as a school of dolphins jumping into the pool, a wedding, and a huge battle on a very large and very dangerous volcano. This is a very classic moment because, although we know them from science history, we can't help but observe and appreciate the amazing work that went into this scene.<br /><br />The acting isn't amazing, and yet we know people are doing their jobs well. The direction is good, and because it has a great opening sequence the story doesn't feel rushed at all. The writing is good, even if you are a classic person. The story doesn't have all that much to do with magic, but the characters and the story-line are excellent and the characters do a fantastic job in this short.<br /><br />When it comes to making a good film, as is, there are a lot of little slant mistakes, like the use of too much black and white, too much mono, and too much soft focus in very short scenes. A lot of bad things happen, but a lot is made up for it by excellent storytelling and very good acting.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of the movies \"Tales from the Sea\" and other TV shows such as \"Tales from the Lips\", you should pick up this one for a couple of bucks. However, if you haven't checked this out and do so, we all suggest that you rent or buy this short together. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"The Haunting\" is easily one of the most hyped movies of the new millennium. It has the backing of many major studios and was shot in Canada. This can lead to a lot of attention from the media. The problem, however, is that with this picture comes the specter of corruption and kickbacks, and how those elements will play out will largely be left to imagination. The other problem with \"The Haunting\" and \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (or whatever it is titled) is that they are trying so hard to make something so expensive that anyone in Hollywood can afford the extravagant package. The film has great production value, but with it comes the specter of bad financial results. It seems that no one in Hollywood wants to make its story available. It was clear that this was a major investment of film-maker Paul Haggis in the writing of the script. Yet, this investment should not have been felt so deep into one of the most\n",

      " anyone like a little of the old magic from a bygone era.<br /><br />The whole thing has that sort of grainy, '80's feeling to it. Like a documentary of a life that wasn't too terribly inspiring. Yeah, we got lost and had a lot of fun. A good time. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Okay, I didn't expect much. I thought this movie would be pretty bad, considering it was based on your typical 80's teen comedies. I mean, it had the old clichés such as the rich girl who is picked on by a kid who lives far away and the lame attempt to make us believe she is a rich girl despite her wealth and a lot of money.<br /><br />It's a shame, because it has the potential to be really funny. The problem was that the jokes just weren't funny. I mean, the main characters have a good voice and personality, but the movie was a big mess. It just didn't have the heart to it enough to carry the movie. But still, it could've been better. I mean, I'm supposed to feel bad for the guy who cheated on his wife and got away with it, but my reaction to his behavior (and this is being a little bit generous here, guys)was \"ahhh, I'm glad I'm single!\" How many times do we have to say that?<br /><br />Anyway, I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again, since it wasn't very entertaining. I give it a 2. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is one of the most bizarre movies ever made. To make it short, when Chris Noth (Jon Voight) first sees the moon he thinks he's back there with us for all of eternity. To make matters worse, he knows that the earth, which has been there for billions of years is the only habitable planet, and that the moon does not have that long in life and that the only lifeforms there are bacteria and archaexonts. The only way that the filmmaker could tell the difference between real and simulated simulated live-action animation was to show the Earth to be covered with dust and have a different colored background. This film made me think of all the many films that are made from movies with the very similar theme to this one. In many ways this films are even more bizarre than that. Maybe they were just trying to make a cheap and campy imitation of the Matrix. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie with a friend who told me to put one star out of four stars. Even though I'm not a big fan of musicals, I put three stars into the rating. That's a double star for a very good performance by Tom Hanks of the \"Gentleman's Agreement\" and one star each for the two excellent performances of Ernie Kovacs of the \"One\" and Michael Douglas of \"That's Incredible.\"<br /><br />All in all, I think that this movie is good entertainment and not all that bad. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I loved it. So I was really excited when I heard it was a B movie. But, of course, it was a B movie. So, while I would not have been overly upset if it had been a LTV movie, I was upset to hear it was a B-movie. I was wrong. It's simply the greatest film ever made. Even though it doesn't have as much historical significance as other films of the time, it truly is a classic. That's all, and I really mean that. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is the most depressing movie I have ever seen. I went to see this film with a group of female friends and we thoroughly enjoyed each other's misery. If you have the opportunity, see it. This is not a lighthearted romantic flick, but a really truly unsettling film which leaves a bitter taste of the sad decline of the world we live in. The way the film is made unnaturally unsettles you. <br /><br />A movie made with no money, no ambition, no passion, no love and no passion for the truth. A movie that should make you sit, though you are not in the cinema, and stare at the wall! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ There are many reasons to watch this movie, but one of them is because of the great acting talent of Sean Connery (as Dr. Grace, a.k.a. Dr. Loomis).<br /><br />In my opinion, Dr. Grace is more of a character actress, and even though her profession isn't exactly important, she is a great actor, especially for the role of Ann. She is a fine actress, and should go on\n",

      ", she did have some good moments, particularly in her scene with the man from the train. She seemed pretty much out of the story. I did like her facial reaction when she saw the ghost. She would have been the first to die in a similar fashion if it happened. Although, it's not hard to see how she would have been killed. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I've seen bad movies, and I've seen good ones, but this one takes the cake. This was one of the few movies I saw for a change of pace a few years back, and boy was I right. This may not be 'Hollywood' with a capital H, but this is a movie that needs to find a literal Holy Grail and find true magic to heal your soul, because after all, movies aren't supposed to make us feel good. There's no way Hollywood could ever make something holy looking like The Sting, so get some LSD and find 'Astro Egalitar' (aka \"The Cure\") instead. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ First, let me point out that I was a student of the history of Pakistan, and also a Fulbright Scholar. Secondly, let me reassure you that this film does not portray the reality. This is a film, and it fails to demonstrate that fact. <br /><br />The filmmakers and even the principal author have failed to bring any factual or logical point of view to the subject of the race relations in this part of Pakistan. Neither the ethnics, nor the politics have any bearing on the serious issues. <br /><br />To conclude, they were able to get a good cast, with some very good production values, that was mainly due to the good quality of the film, but it had to carry the burden of it's historical context. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ <br /><br />As others have stated, the first \"Saving Grace\" and \"Candyman\" movies in the \"Hollywood Revue\" series were excellent. However, they were two different movies. This was not a typical revival movies of the 1940s or 1950s; it was a totally new character; one that Grace Moore didn't get nearly enough credit for. It may have made more sense for a new movie, however. This movie was about Grace, a housewife living in Philadelphia who gets a job as a secretary in the Whitehouse. She gets a job that requires her to do favors for multiple people in the Whitehouse--from her chauffeur to her boss (who has an annoying habit of throwing things at her and saying things that she doesn't understand.) A big favor in the Whitehouse requires someone in the family to call the local sheriff and tell them what is going on. The problem is, they can't do it because the sheriff is on duty; someone has to. So Grace tries everything in her power to convince the Sheriff to call the President and tell him what is going on. This starts a conspiracy and Grace gets dragged into a love triangle that ends with a surprise twist that was a surprise even a little bit \"Saving Grace\" would have given a lot of credit for. I was expecting a Hollywood version of \"The Big Bertha;\" I got a little more of a realistic view of the people in \"The Whitehouse\" but they didn't make any big splash with this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I am a major Martin Short fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. His portrayal of a hard-to-believe high school baseball team is brilliant, from his motivational coach to his character's coach. This is a film that will take you in, and will end with you leaving the theater feeling good and ready for the next day ahead. A true romantic, but as much a roller coaster ride as the great Hollywood tripe that it was produced by the studios. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie was great. I am not saying that it is or should be viewed as bad, because... I'm sure it's entertaining and fun... but I hope it will make you laugh. I like good jokes and good stuff.... so this wasn't a struggle for me. If your looking for good comedy with a good story line... I'm sure you will love this... but if you are looking for cheap thrills just look somewhere else. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am a big fan of the Cylons/Lemmon show and have seen some very good science fiction films, but this one is my first that is not based on a true story and it sucks. If you love watching science fiction as it happens in these early days of television... or even back when it was new...you will love this. I'm sure I've seen it, or at least the first few seasons that I saw. If\n",

      " the movie is. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ What can I say? One of my favorite things about this series are the recurring dream-movies. If you have ever had a bad dream, chances are you have seen many movies like these. If not, it's probably not because you're a child or because you never grow up in the same kind of way that the characters does. It's because of the strong and unspoken dreams of all the characters that give the movie such a good flavor.<br /><br />I see that this is shown so much on the \"MTV network\" right now. I have no problem with that because on its own it's a fantastic series. But it will never really have it's full glory, and this is the definitive episode, that it was. It's something we don't often think of in TV shows. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I first saw this film over thirty years ago on T.V. when I was a kid called \"The War Wagon Riders\", and since then it has become one of my favorite films. It has some of the best dialogue of any film ever, and is a good blend of action with comedy. You can tell it is written by veterans of the old West Coats Army and the Civil War both in looks and in mind. Very watchable even for a guy coming from the 60's. Worth seeing more than once. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am shocked that not everyone who watches this movie is a fan of Bollywood movies. Most scenes are very hard to translate. The two major problems are obvious when the actor/actress hasn't been in Bollywood before, and secondly the way in which the dialogues are put together is very confusing. I would have preferred that the dialogue not have been this way, but I am glad that some scenes were rushed because otherwise the movie just seemed clumsy. I hope that the script writer and other cast members will find other ways to make their movie better. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"I thought I would give it a try\".....actually, it took me ten years to watch this because, for all the reasons mentioned above, this was just a very bad movie.<br /><br />At the beginning you get the impression that its just another mindless story; but when it reaches the finish, you realize that its so badly executed you are cheering your local, state, or country against it in case it sinks deeper than itself.<br /><br />If you like bad movies that try harder than the majority of the movies that have been making their way into the cinemas since the early 70s, you will probably like this. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I'm not going to lie: I didn't like \"The Big Bad Swim\". Although, I did enjoy \"Punk's Temple\". It has to be one of the worst B movies I've ever watched. This doesn't have much going for it either: all the characters are boring/vulnerable, the plot (if there is one) is ridiculous and in the end you will just want your money back.<br /><br />If you have no other choice...don't bother. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is one of those \"mature\" American teen films that have so grown, that I would consider it hard to give it a 'thn\" rating; but I can stand to see it once or twice (maybe twice or three times) - and, as for the acting and the characters, it's more than fine. The young teens will feel at home in the film (and be, as mightily obvious to a youngster, adult) and, unlike in some other films, they'll be comfortable as a 'adult' in their own skin. For me, that's enough to keep me watching. Perhaps it will get a bit preachy by the end, but for anyone that's ever grown up, I wouldn't be surprised. For someone younger, I was pleasantly surprised to get the impression that I may have grown up rather rather than just been taken from childhood. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In the 1980's, the TV sitcom was at it's peak. A young Paulie was the most successful part and I really hope I didn't watch all the episodes with him. One in particular which I can remember most vividly involved two teenagers (and I'm being polite about using this word) who went to a house, and for no good reason, except that it was to take a part of Paulie and his family (my daughter-in-law and I's boyfriend). The main point of the story was how Paulie attempted to help the family in almost every episode but never got what he asked for. It turned out that the house was cursed and it\n",

      " ON: The original movie, \"The Menagerie,\" was very well made. It had good music, strong story and good characters. This updated movie has only the sexiest and most sensual voice of James Mason. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I'm a huge fan of the Muppet movies and this is the third one in a row that we see Muppets doing on-stage, (but not film-directing). I wasn't expecting much from this since Muppet3 came out so a bit on the lighter side, but was still disappointed. I'd like to say I understand the fans disappointment of such an outdated plot and with a lack of Muppets at the centre. I just have to say I'd rather watch the live Muppet films then this. The songs are not really that memorable, all the Muppets are more like caricatures of their characters in an old time show, no character is really memorable and for that, this isn't a very good film. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ What makes the film unique and appealing to me is the simplicity that it is. I feel as if it were another film like 'The English Patient' or 'Sidney' - a film about ordinary people who weaves the life of others. The performances of all the performers was superb, from the top to the bottom to the middle class to down to the everyday people. I felt as if I was watching a film with no real plot - just people of ordinary who happen to be living each day.<br /><br />I do think that it has many weaknesses though. You know - maybe I should have said that, because I guess this would be a 'somethings come out of left field' film. But this film is a lot deeper than that. The story is about human relationships, so no matter that it has been adapted for children and adults, it certainly does not contain any clichés, and the characters are well-drawn even if not overdone, and the camera-work is very nice. The story is not predictable, but just doesn't seem to get in the way of the plot, so the characters are enjoyable. At times it seems an old man is narrating, but, of course, he doesn't sound like a regular ordinary person, and that is nice in a 'film noir' kind of way.<br /><br />The story is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen since I saw the film 'I am a fish' about three years ago. I don't like the sound of rain in my homes, but this film is so beautiful that you can't help but breath; and the feeling of being in a beautiful place, with great beaches, fairytales, beautiful mountains, and all the other great things the film gives us. Wonderful film. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie may also be a classic of the era! As seen, the film is not about an evil spirit, but is rather a supernatural tale that revolves around a girl who, after falling from a bridge, returns to the place where she once belonged and destroys the supernatural spirit's influence. The bridge she falls on also has the ability to drain the souls of those who come into contact with it. (You understand this better during the credits, when the voice on the television comes to life and utters the immortal words \"Come back to earth, Earth. Return to our Earth.\") The film is not without its share of gore--some good, some very bad, and all-the-magnificient, so we must judge it on its own merits. While not a traditional or adult film, it does have a good deal of clevée and is recommended for people of a youth and older ages. (It may be of some assistance to the young viewer.) Still it is a movie I suggest you watch once, just to get your teeth into the whole ordeal. (The title itself is, of course, confusing--a reference to \"The Devil's Triangle.\") _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I had a great time at the World Expo for a few of the producers of this movie and enjoyed it immensely. It is true that the whole thing sounded like a lot of other movies but that is not the main reason I rented this one.<br /><br />The acting was terrible and the action scenes were nothing to write about. The camera work was sloppy and the effects were laughable. The plot is not original and is very poorly constructed. This movie is not so bad, it is simply bad. The movie makes absolutely no sense and was a complete mess as far as violence and suspense goes.<br /><br />The main problem with this movie, apart from the horrible acting and poorly constructed plot, was the completely unbelievable plot twist at the end. It looked like it was taken from an old Star Wars video or something similar.\n",

      " z _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If you like cheesy horror, \"Troll\" is for you. Some great gags, and some genuinely sad scenes too. The movie has a strange, surrealized quality that makes it a great movie for a dark subject where people in the dark are not necessarily a desirable group. \"Troll\" is a wonderful little movie. This is one to see on a rainy day if you can't have a nice movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this show when it premiered on ABC in late 2006, and it has to be one of the better shows of the time, if not the best.<br /><br />Not only was the casting good, but so were the lines, especially Mike's lines.<br /><br />Not only is his acting great, but the writing and the lines are great. His is real emotion, as opposed to a show on SNL. He just doesn't need to be a comic to have authenticity to his acting. It was like watching someone be himself (or someone else in some strange way) in a very weird situation. For some people, that is weird, for Mike, it is a quality laugh and really makes you think about life in general. That is really true.<br /><br />It is so rare for the person who has a real problem to be able to laugh at themselves for being so helpless. It's a huge surprise to see that Mike, his issues, and his show are so underappreciated in show writing.<br /><br />The world must be made aware of his unique talent, and it should be on par with his comic talents and a show must be made. This show gives so much in that.<br /><br />If I have anything to say, it is not good, just to make fans in fact. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I found a copy of this episode on DVD. It was titled \"A Man Under The Influence\". It's the one with the dead child and the witch is in on Halloween.<br /><br />I think there were too many lines that were just used over and over again but I just couldn't remember them. There doesn't seem to be a lot of consistency or story. It's just used as a vehicle for the child and the witch.<br /><br />Also there was no connection between the witch and the dead child. He doesn't make any appearances in the film. He merely appears after the child left the room and went out of the room and didn't come back. This is a very odd scene. There is no way in the life of me that the child could have gone out and gotten his coat, he left his dog in the room. It simply could have not happened that way.<br /><br />It would be a great movie to see if they had more people like me in their comedy. I don't think it's the most original that is used but it's the only thing that works. We just might see a different side of what we just saw which is great.<br /><br />If you are curious about any of the actors and story it could be a good movie to see but keep in mind that the production values could have been better. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I recently purchased a DVD with my husband \"Mildred Pierce\" as the \"best\" on the shelf for me. I had high hopes for this movie. But, I was extremely disappointed by this movie. The plot does not hold together, the acting is below-par and the comedy is worse than a school film.<br /><br />Why was this movie released in the summer of 2006? Are you kidding me? This was one of the worst Summer movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />It's not that the movie isn't good. I loved the book from which this story is based. All of the actors in this movie are fine. But the adaptation of it to screen does a terrible disservice to the story. I will not go into the details of the story but it's a shame that it wasn't done the right way. Instead, it was done taking liberties, making up all sorts of things and embellishments that didn't matter in the first place. In short, it doesn't follow all of the story it ought to. And, what was most disappointing was that the movie itself was made by a guy, who is obviously not very talented or very smart as other filmmakers have claimed. The movie tries very hard, but it is simply put, very amateurish.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip \"A Man Under The Influence\". The story and acting in this movie are fine, well-done. But, the movie was not the story or the performance. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ How\n",

      " a negative rating. It's a movie that you will want to re-view several times. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ One of the finest films to ever portray Australia - and I'm very grateful to have been so close to a live one when it was on.<br /><br />We need more musicals, more dancing and more singing in this country, folks; what a wonderful country - but still one with a wonderful and wonderful side. Take a look at Perth, you will be deeply, deeply touched.<br /><br />My heart goes out to all the really unfortunate people in Australia who have been unable to escape reality... and the reality is that we don't care. We know that we don't know the human race; but this production does not. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is the kind of movie where the acting is so bad it makes your hairs stand on end and where the dialogue sounds like it was written by the same old script writers who wrote Breakfast at Tiffany's (1940).<br /><br />The \"acting\" - as in there was a lot of it - was absolutely horrible - with really nothing to back it up. For instance, if you are wondering who had the most rings, the answer might surprise anyone who's seen the movie, but it would be a unanimous choice among the cast. What kept me from giving it a 1 was that there were some nice tunes, but they just didn't fit in with the rest of the movie. The film is only around an hour long, so you can't spoil it for a sequel. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The most disturbing part of this movie was the final five minutes which showed the two main actors doing their best to dance in the background (the movie)... and with \"dancing\" being a euphemism by the writers for \"prostitutes, prostitutes, prostitutes...\". I know it's from the 18th century, but is that the case? I think the director should have followed the French in the 18th century -- they do have the \"dancer in the background\" with the playing of \"the troupe\" in a \"dancing\" play. But that's a different story for another movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _End of an Era _END_REVIEW_ I really like this movie! Its about the \"Gone\" (an acronym for Global Guardians which stands for \"Government Control,\" that is, the lack of freedom in a free country). As in \"The Sting,\" \"Stargate\" and other movies that are about people inside a huge satellite of a company, the plot is simple and predictable, so for the vast majority of the movie one way will come true and then another side will come true. This movie is so good, that it makes my opinion, in this movie the end of the 90's. It was not that bad and did have some good moments here and there including the final fight which was pretty cool. The acting, which is good if you like the actors, is pretty average, so if you like the actors, you will probably like this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"A Man Who Was Murdered By Himself\" is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is a good mystery/suspense movie and if you want to see a good mystery/suspense movie, you have to see this movie. I have seen this movie thousands of times and I am still bored. I usually do not watch anything original but when a movie is this good I like it a lot. I think the reason I would not see this movie is because \"A Man Who Was Murdered By Himself\" is just not very interesting, subtle or interesting. Why would a detective who has been in this kind of job really want to confess to a murder that he did? If that was about the reason, I'm not sure what to make of the police being the victims of a murder themselves. I really don't like this ending because it is so vague and makes no sense. I am going through my copy right now and I have seen this movie on and off since I can remember the whole thing.<br /><br />The direction is good in this movie and it certainly wasn't robbed by any of the actors. I especially like the camera work because it makes me go, \"Oh my God, it is so beautiful!\" The movie really shines here!<br /><br />The acting is great throughout the movie and they give really good performances. I especially like the cast of this movie. If you are going to watch a mystery/suspense movie, I suggest you to see this one! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ ...and thats about it?

      "-man. I wish they had never tried to bring in Hollywood and other \"experts\" and just just used real people who truly know about the medical field. I know I could go on and on about how sick the world is but I don't care. They just didn't do anything and I think that people who say that this is some kind of a \"courageous\" or \"honorable\" way of showing bravery in showing people how sick the world is just don't get what they want to say. I don't see how anyone could be proud that some guys like James \"The Rock\" O'Leary got some kind of a medical degree on top of their degree in Journalism or something. They are either too busy trying to make a movie or they don't actually care. If anything this \"documentary\" is actually quite sad, as these guys have \"experts\" who actually know some about medical physics or medicine or something! I mean what are they doing doctor? It's actually kind of sick and twisted to see this \"experts\" of some \"experts\" actually advising some other sick and twisted guys about medical physics! I mean it's just not honorable or brave at all. I mean seriously please don't watch this film. In case the film makers really did need to get their medical degree's in some medical school to be this \"experts\" with \"experts\" who actually know some about medical physics and stuff like that: Well fine if that's your thing, fine by and by. I mean its not really scientific itself and the \"experts\" are for the most part criminals or worse. Maybe if they had a little more education up their sleeves and actually took some classes on the medical profession, then maybe they would have a little more knowledge up their sleeve of \"experts\" in what actually is an \"experts\" show. I mean do yourselves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"The Man\" is possibly the best cult actioner ever, and is a very good action film indeed.The plot could be considered weak if any one particular cult actor who plays the role of the protagonist, but that would still be meaningless and pointless to say here.The acting performances are very good, the story could be considered very good, the action could be considered very good, the story could be considered very good and the directing could be considered very good.All of these could be said about some cult movies in general, but they can't be in more than one category.The Man is a truly great action film that can be easily recommended to all fans of good cult films.I'm sure it would please the fans of even cult classics like Alien,Blade Runner and even James Cameron's Aliens. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ i first saw this film back in the mid 90's when it came out on VHS. I was so blown away by it and the soundtrack to it. I never watched the TV show in its original run, as though it should be a TV show. A full hour at the movies I still can't get my TV show on, because I think about the show as some of the best television shows on, and I can't imagine anyone except John Krasinski getting involved. Now I'm seeing it on DVD, and I'm hooked. It's a bit cheesy at times, but that's what it's all about, right? I never thought it could take itself seriously, so the acting isn't all that memorable, but the whole theme of it being all about the characters, isn't just an original concept, it's really been done. It's just that bad. But, the actors are all up to the task of carrying the movie, and the set is pretty lavish. There's even a great underground set, complete with a huge barbed-wire contraption at the bottom of the river. I don't know that I'd call this a 'bad' movie, but it's certainly a good one. It's just a bit far-fetched for a TV show. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ There are some serious problems with this \"little gem\".<br /><br />The first is that the characters, in their early 30's, look damn good - or at least young. Some of them have been there. And some of them have been here before. Which makes the movie seem less like an epic and more like another Romeo-Juliet love story. Of course these are people whose lives had to turn, but damn if the writers would have done anything when they had a chance!<br /><br />The second is that this has to be some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. I could make a better movie if I wrote one. Here the dialogue is full of swear words, as if someone had poured a giant bowl of _____ outta a typewriter. I wouldn't even use\n",

      " factors in my world. I can't believe this was the writer/director of The Book of Life's and the Director's of THE DANDS, Peter Savage. It's a crime that only the author and artist could have committed. It's shameful. The film is terrible. But there is much worse! You've got a pretty good cast. A young Joaquin Phoenix. A powerful, and really young, Jessica Alba. And what of a talented and beautiful Anna Parillá? We have even seen her with a cigarette on her mouth. The story, while simple, doesn't really explain much. I had no trouble understanding the plot, the characters, the dialogue, the story. We knew what was going on, it was just a matter of understanding what happened next, and what would happen next. We got nothing but a lot of unexplained scenes.<br /><br />There is a little scene that was extremely powerful, but I don't remember what it was: there is a shot where Jessica Alba's character is having a conversation with a man, and we see a chair in front of her that someone has just sat down and just turned away. We can't see anything in the image-we are just watching a black-and-white T.V. screen. The man speaks, and the chair turns back, and... nothing. There are 2 moments when the characters start to work together, and there's a lot of tension, but it's not because the man is threatening the women; It's because he isn't able to give a good reason to his behavior or just refuses to listen. After awhile I was getting tired of the situation; but then I started to remember that this was still a movie. I laughed out loud several times, and I'm usually a pretty light-skinned guy, but I felt like the characters were just trying to act in a realistic manner, and they didn't try to look like \"blaxploitation\". They acted like real people! You need to see this movie for the wonderful acting and terrific cinematography, and then for the story, it just seemed like a really good movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is the worst movie, and the lowest scoring one with a total score of 1 out of 10. I've seen this in the theaters, but at least by the time I got it to the door it was a very slow start. I can see now why this was the lowest scoring entry of 1984, and it's the only film I've ever walked out on (along with \"Lamb's Creek\" which I also walked out on). The acting in this film is really good, with the good work done by Tom McLoughlin (who also acted in \"Haven't Looked Like Love\" and \"Lebellis\", but I wouldn't trust that to the same standard as in \"Lamb's Creek\"). Even his worst movies tend to have a kind of charm, which this film doesn't match.<br /><br />In addition, some, if not most, of the characters seem to have no real personality, and it's hard to sympathize with them. I don't know what those were trying to accomplish, except to cause trouble, and a great deal of it. Why would a great-aunt or something have such a terrible temper? And the scene where the family gets back together and makes up, that I will never forget, is one of the most powerful parts of the whole film.<br /><br />This is a truly, soul-wasting film. Don't waste your time watching it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is the most touching and heart-stricken film of all eras. It had tremendous appeal then in that it was the first film by an outsider; yet the content is timeless. It was a rare opportunity to see early cinema that did not reflect the fashion in which it was received. And it is timeless, because the film is not a piece of art, it is a common heartache.<br /><br />There are wonderful performances by a very very sweet and talented cast. Both Ben Gazzara and Patricia Clarkson are exceptional; and, when Gazzara dies in a plane crash, the film is touching, because it shows that tragedy and suffering can only be experienced by being seen - and this happens in a film. In a sad day of the year, it shows that films can be the end of an artist's artistic career. The films show that people (and sometimes entire families) can be killed by a broken heart, but they can do better - and that this progress is good for people.<br /><br />This is the kind of film that keeps you thinking and empathetic. What made it such a moving, well-made and moving classic is that they made it, and it is the kind of film that can touch the soul; because it will change all the characters' lives, especially\n",

      "<br /><br />Another major problem in this film is the plot. The film has a number of interesting themes -- a romance between a girl who finds a man (with whom she's still single) and a boy who develops a love for her -- but it just doesn't make any sense at all.<br /><br />Also, the acting is mostly stiff. You see the actors trying very hard, but without success.<br /><br />However -- if you're the sort of person who loves these type of films, and finds the story and story lines quite hilarious, good, entertaining, and thought-provoking, you'll love and appreciate it. It's not a complete waste, but it certainly is not worth wasting two hours to find out. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In truth this really is a movie that everybody will enjoy, although certainly not as a fan of the genre. It is a great thriller, but not a horror; it is far from being scary! The acting is excellent, the plot is intriguing. The direction is very good and suspenseful, the photography is beautiful.<br /><br />If you enjoy a good thriller, you won't find here any faults. The movie is full of suspense and surprises, the plot is good, but the drama in the film and in the plot is a bit far from being convincing. Nevertheless it is entertaining and highly recommended.<br /><br />8 out of 10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A few brief comments on the movie: <br /><br />1. Some reviewers have mentioned that the film did not really advance the themes of love and war. I would agree that it did not say anything new or even had any flaws of its own.<br /><br />2. When war breaks out, in the middle of being filmed in a city near the coast (and a very, very quiet one at that), it becomes very close. The love that we saw in the first movie is pretty much what the director and actors are used to at this point and, especially when you are only four years old, it is hard to understand clearly which side of the conflict you are on.<br /><br />3. It must be admitted that the movie did a slightly better job depicting the German invasion than the British invasion into World War Two. However, considering the age of the actors and the age of the filmmakers at the time the Germans seemed far worse. I would not call the Germans a more convincing invading force than the British, but they still make some of the better ones. As I said, I just think the Americans and the Soviets were far better. <br /><br />As I said, the main point seems to be war between two brothers. When the Germans invaded France, they wanted to have peace, the Catholics in France were tired of having to fight, a more peaceful time in their life was what was being offered them. The Catholics wanted peace in the streets of Paris.<br /><br />4. The ending is confusing because everything is confusing and it is just a question to me, who am I, in my right mind, to decide whether this story is a dream or reality. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This film is an absolute masterpiece, and I only hope that more people watch this film, because it's so damn brilliant. This film is great. It's got lots of great music and acting and story lines. And when you see the ending where all the people are running around and doing nothing (not even thinking) and they're all happy, I'm sure that in the real world everyone in the world would be getting paid to play in this film!!<br /><br />But it would be great to see it as a children's movie. Because the kids will never understand it at all.<br /><br />And also the fact that after they see it, they then spend eight years, thinking, and loving it makes it so great. I could watch this movie over and over and over again and still never get bored.<br /><br />The only reason I haven't actually seen it, is because I haven't seen enough of it to see it all - the original. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Like another reviewer remarked, this movie has some of the cleverest dialogue you can ever encounter in a movie and the acting to boot. The movie is about the ultimate \"blah\" movie -- but the movie as an art-house masterpiece rather than an average schlock movie. The director is the famous \"American director\" Max Allan who was the director of \"The Miracle Worker\", \"The Miracle Dog\" and \"Godzilla's monster\". He was also the director of \"Jurassic park 4: meet your male cousins\" and a few other movies. \"The World has been turned upside-down\" was what some people would call an\n",

      " guy and I loved it! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I just loved this movie, even though it was NOT my favorite movie I was in the audience sitting next to the guy who gave it to me.<br /><br />I think that the reason that the film had not been given a 10 was that nobody in the theatre could actually see it, but I must see it now, as it has never been shown on TCM or HBO. If it ever should be shown on TV, the DVD player will be too late... _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am sorry, but the only time I have ever walked out on a movie was in a movie theater. This movie was not a movie, but it was actually a TV series! It was very disappointing. All the actors were wonderful, the plot was intriguing, but the movie was not what I had hoped for. I was not disappointed in the least. My only disappointment was that I lost all my money in the process of renting the movie series and not seeing it until I was nearly ready to throw up, and then I did see it. If you are in the mood for a long walk (with friends) and you don't feel like getting lost, or you want to laugh at a comedy as opposed to a drama, I recommend this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In this pre-modern world, with all its horrors, I don't understand how people would want to put this piece of trash in a cinema and have it be a prequel of sorts to the world we know today, or in fact, the world which was twenty years, or so, ago. A world which was, in the end, already destroyed by a horrible plague, except for one little survivor, is also a world that did not need the film of this movie put into it, because it is simply horrible and did not need to be depicted in this way. A man who has survived only by his imagination, cannot imagine that anyone else would be so foolish to have put this sickness in his mouth, nor can he imagine that his actions would possibly be so despicable. As for people who are commenting on how this new world has great culture and wonders, how can you expect that after the first fifteen minutes of this movie? In fact the only point of the movie (which was actually the only part which I actually didn't fast forward) was to entertain the dumb audience by showing them a world we've never seen before, and telling them how awesome this world truly is. By doing this, the filmmakers have made this whole film a bunch of b-movie clichés. I'm sorry, but I find this film insulting to anyone who has not experienced what these people apparently saw in the movies, and believe me I'm not the only one who has. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Wow. It's one thing to watch this movie as an odd curiosity. It's one huge genre failure. But to have someone make another totally incoherent, incoherent movie in a day is, in my opinion, incredibly daring.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious to anyone who's ever tried to make a movie as their first stab at an artistic breakthrough, that if you're going to turn a novel into a movie, then you've gotta have some sort of cohesion, some sort of flow.<br /><br />When the script is that poorly written and directed it's incredibly difficult in any situation to write an interesting script. Even better, it's impossible to write an interesting script when the plot is so far-fetched. You have characters you have no relationship with, a character that has no development at all, and characters that just randomly appear out of nowhere.<br /><br />But no one is giving in. And in an attempt to at least raise awareness of the movie and its director, the film's writer and co-star, Jamie Brett Gabel, decides to do just that. By writing about a terminally ill terminally ill terminator trying to raise funds for his daughter's cancer, they throw in a couple of terminally ill terminator transplants, and it's supposed to be about some boy who wants to raise awareness of cancer by doing kayaks and visiting the beach. But instead of trying to raise thousands of dollars for cancer research, they go all out by making an incredibly far-fetched movie. If only I could say the same for the screenplay. They write about the main character struggling to make his head out in a miserable marriage, that's fine by me. It's entirely up to him to make it through the day. This entire movie revolved around him, and I was left wanting more. The whole movie made me want to close my eyes and turn off the light.<br /><br />If you're up for a movie that you can only call entertaining then my advise is to rent it and make your self a better filmmaker\n",

      " exercise. There was very little plot and there was very little tension or fear.<br /><br />The only saving grace was a fine performance by Brad Dourif, whom I personally believe was unfairly maligned by producers. This was because at times he seemed uncomfortable in front of the camera and the general press was reluctant to touch him. I believe the producers wanted him to play \"The Hero.\" There seemed to be no need to do so.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was fairly equally bad.<br /><br />All in all, a bad movie experience. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The reason that this film was made and the reason that I view it every time I watch Blu Ray, is because I always watch all 50 movies that I know would never happen out to be in a theatre. Then, once, 10 years in a row with a single movie, so that's what keeps me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />There's enough plot, as shown in the beginning of the film, to make almost anyone weep. Not that it's all predictable, of course it's more like a series of events instead of a chain-link storyline; as all those good kids always say - \"Don't worry, it's alright\" - but you just hope that maybe the change will be good enough to keep on coming.<br /><br />The biggest surprise is that it does even more than meets the eye. The plot and development are quite good and there's enough reason for adults to be enthralled by it a bit, but, in this case, a wonderful surprise is waiting to show itself! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I love movies just like this one!!! It's so interesting that while being funny, without being pretentious, it shows what a very charming and engaging movie in every aspect it is; it provides a perfect way to pass some leisure time! The actors were OK, but the script is so unique and funny that it deserves much better attention. The acting was excellent and you can't help but admire the comedy of the film. The story was so unique that you can't help but find it and find that great one-liners and a perfect way to approach the work. I am so glad to have seen this film, and hope to see a sequel. It's a wonderful film and if the script isn't a great one, then this is certainly a good one!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The third film, of three is about. There is not much plot of the others, but this stuff gives a great taste of the weirdness and the unbridled joy that is life in Zurich. The music is perfect, and the cinematography is top-rate (a big plus in my book!). It's as true to the novel's style, which is not to say that it is a \"dumb\" film. This is a film that puts you in those times, people around the same time, with kindred spirits. Not many films can do that! <br /><br />For a nice story, you can't ask for much more! The music is terrific; particularly the last five-minute scene (where the music is really sweet and lyrical, with the vocals really loud and great--don't laugh, it was very brave!), and the performances from all performers make a good film watch, and that is pretty rare. (well, to be honest, at first i didnt really know who it was. I was just looking for a good \"wanna be a star and forget what a crappy film it is\" film, and I was pleasantly surprised, but it's something worth seeing again, I guess!) If you have got about five minutes to watch, then get through this, then the next thing you know, you're going home! :)<br /><br />And now I'm gonna go get my copy of this film. I'm gonna watch it again. I doubt anyone else will, so maybe I can go see it again before it's all finished.<br /><br />-o/<br /><br />PS: There's a great performance by a young Tanya Roberts, that will become known. She plays Sophie Rochon (and it was cool)! :) _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I had the rare misfortune of watching this in the theater at a showing of The Book of Life.<br /><br />Before I read about this film, I knew almost nothing about it. And it was not a good showing.<br /><br />So I sat down and watched this with no intention of something good. I read the book's book and the movie, before the movie, and not only did I forget something, I forgot completely.<br /><br />This is how the writer of the book really was: the book was great, the script was\n",

      "livion; the only thing about the film that is not entirely bad is the music, though; it is somewhat overdone (and at least a bit annoying) and does get a touch syrupy, but the film is far better for the music than for any of the visuals, which are, in this case, the most compelling aspect of the film. The film is not a perfect representation of a typical movie, because there are elements of dialogue that are not quite there (some of the best dialogue in the film is during the opening credits, but I've seen scenes with more important dialogue in the film floating around in space), and there are elements of the film that are almost non-existent. Most of the film has dialog around some generic plot terms that are not fully explained at the end of the film, or during the course of this particular film. Other aspects of the film just seem to happen in a blur of time and no place or time at all. Some of the dialogue actually sounds silly; it makes the scenes from the film appear weird to someone else who is not familiar with the film. <br /><br />The acting is excellent. Tom Braid's performance is great (and believable) throughout the film, and he brings plenty of humanity to the role of the \"possessed\". Jodie Foster's and Helen Mirren's performances are also quite good. The rest of the cast also do fine and unique performances.<br /><br />Finally, the music in this film is the best one I've ever heard. The music of the film fits perfectly into the scenes that are meant to be tense, emotional, or dramatic. All in all, this film delivered what I expected from it's characters and their motivations (which were well done), and far surpassed my expectations! 7/10 stars on this one page! I'm giving this film a solid 7 out of 10 stars, and I'm not just kidding! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw a screening of this one last night at our university theater. The theater was packed when I came in. At one point, as one of the students, I had to take a huge two-minute break at the end of the movie. I'm a big fan of the director, and for the most part, the actors fit the film! I also was pleasantly surprised - the movie is quite unique and different from most of its kind. So if you are a fan of bad movies, or are interested in a more serious interpretation of the genre, don't miss this one. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a \"mini\" film for \"The War Wagon\" starring a young Susan Sarandon as the wagon mistress of a famous cattle stand. I was surprised to note that at one point, Ms. Sarandon says, \"I'm not just a girl anymore.\" That is a valid observation.<br /><br />But the \"Mountain West\" setting is not meant to imply the plains of the northwest were \"rugged\".<br /><br />The film is about three men - a saloon owner, his old wagon mistress and a young western blacker - who are hired by a young cattle herdie to protect him from a bandit. The three are not likable characters. One of them is a drunken gambler, another's a gambler with a gambling problem, and another has a reputation of being prejudiced.<br /><br />However, they all work together for a great deal of money. This is a great western - it features fine acting, fine writing, and a great deal of dialogue. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The movie has some wonderful imagery of the natural flow of rivers in an almost landscape. There is the obvious danger in attempting to emulate nature's flow but then at the end of the day, if the movie and art direction are attempting to emulate nature's flow then what is the point? This movie is trying to make a statement and does a good job of it which was a positive step in my mind. This movie is a cute and light movie with beautiful art direction and great imagery to go along with it. I loved not having to think, figure out details. The only problem was that I had trouble following the story at times. Wasn't that a bad thing? I thought it was a cute and light movie with good art direction and music. The only downside to the movie was that it was short to the point of not watching the entire thing. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is the worst movie with George Segal I have seen. There is no story the movie only just about George Segal and how he feels about what happened on line with his name in the credits. It has horrible acting that is not even remotely close to acting for any movie other then for example The Matrix, Fight Club or The Fast and the Furious. It is impossible to watch this\n",

      "which of course, is the very funniest part of the film). <br /><br />And the soundtrack: I am a big fan of Bauhaus/Foner tunes and I love the German house/psychedelic music that is so integral to the movie, in particular the song (which also contains the very funny dance number \"Ooga-Bout\" [which is one of the funniest songs I've ever heard!]!).<br /><br />A must-see. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The most enjoyable aspect of this film is the chemistry between the lead characters. They are all good natured and enjoyable and have a natural chemistry. Some of them do go on to become serious actors. While not bad actors, they aren't bad at all. The women in the film are also delightful, especially the old ones. In one scene, a young woman looks at a man in a chair and says, \"Who would have thought a man with a head full of holes could be a woman?\" It is such an amusing moment, one of the best comedies I have found, yet still worth noting on the movie's DVD sleeve. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I'm looking for some more films from the writers of the title but I couldn't find any. I have tried to look here for some one shot pieces with nothing but \"Cherry\" and \"Lovely & Damned\" but all I can find are movies with the word C and nothing in between...The only other film I can find with that title is The Devil's Wedding. So if someone has a more useful film to feature, please tell me. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It really was an incredible experience. I'd never heard of Neil Abercrombie or Joe Astor but his writing was brilliant. It was as natural an emotion watching him on screen as it was watching him in the chair where he was working. The film also offered much of the insight Joe felt into a whole lot of things he's writing about. Like I said, \"It's interesting - at least to watch and listen.\" The camera has a lot to do with that. The lens moves over his face as soon as he says one word. The same thing happens in the movie. And the sound effects are amazing. The camera work is amazing and the voices are amazing. This doesn't get any more amazing than when I watch an interview with Abercrombie.\"I just remember him saying that when I didn't think I understood what he was saying.\"The only regret is that I used too many clips from the film. It takes a lot of work. The film is so interesting and is so different from normal movies.\"The only one fault I have is that their film production is a little less than true - and it could have been made smoother and with a more natural feel.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If you're looking for an action movie, you might enjoy it. If you wish to experience human drama in a story-less, if possibly unprovoked, film about a man's struggle with faith, then read on.<br /><br />I am not a Christian, nor do I believe everything the Bible says. This is not intended to be a scientific study; but the Bible is full of references pointing in that direction.<br /><br />What is most striking to me is the lack of emotion and the slow moving shots that leave you wishing you were anywhere. It really gets to me when I take my two-year-old son to pray with me.<br /><br />I can not believe that so many intelligent, decent people would stoop so low to make such a piece of dreck.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This was the only time I saw my father. And I really liked this movie. <br /><br />It's easy to see why it is known as one of the best French films ever made. It's like nothing you've ever seen before. And it's nice to see. <br /><br />It's also nice to see this film again.<br /><br />I also like the plot very much. If you've never seen this film, you might find this film hard to understand - but the film is very enjoyable and charming. You don't have to study the plot and so on. Just like you wouldn't have to study a lot of your favourite movies, it is nice to see again. (The film probably wouldn't work with subtitles.)<br /><br />The performances were very nice. The only reason that I don't rate this film so high (which is not up for discussion) is because I have trouble understanding this guy, whose name I know, without any doubts, as a \"professional actor\".

      ". We don't have that kind of film in the U.S.; we also have very \"modern\" films that are set in today's world. We don't want this kind of film because it doesn't match today's world.<br /><br />This film had to be big budget, no matter how much it had to cost. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ My Wife and I saw this movie in our \"as-free-council-council-family-film-group rental\" yesterday. It was really bad as well, although it is not one of those low-budget low-budget \"film noir\" movies. I don't really like that genre and I thought this movie did a good job of not being the story, as such, but I got it at a price. I also didn't like some of the character choices, in certain scenes. The best actor was in this one (his name actually is Gary Graham, but I guess not) and he definitely was not the main character. I was surprised to hear that they made the \"in-name-only\" sequels. If I had known that the sequels were going to be so bad I would of rented them beforehand, but I'm glad I did not. I didn't like how the characters were presented either. There isn't really a clear connection to the \"main character\", so I got confused. It seemed like it was more the story if any of the other characters, especially the main one, was killed. I liked the music overall, though I had no reason to rent it. I didn't realize the soundtrack was so cheesy, but it was just a little cheesy. I could not believe that I had bought the soundtrack a month earlier.<br /><br />My advice- buy this movie if you have nothing else to do- there isn't much to it. If you are interested in seeing a poor script and a bad actor, bad acting and really bad character choices, see a low budget movie, you might want to see some of the stars in it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I am a fan of many musicals but this was really bad but I really enjoyed myself. What really was surprising about it is why this had a strong following. There are three reasons. 1. It is set in NYC (i.e. the musical sequences shot inside NYC are very unique). 2. It has great songs like\"All Over the World\"(I know I just said the title, but don't tell anyone),\"Beaches\"(I know it is a terrible movie, but really I didn't know that),<br /><br />or 3. The actors are atypical.<br /><br />I will mention only one really notable performance. The woman who played Lola did good. She reminds me of the good actress/singer from New York. Her role was a perfect way to show Lola's love and devotion to Lola. I can imagine the women in those old MGM musicals singing and dancing with this woman for much the same story.<br /><br />Some other performance are very good for well done musicals. The music's here are not too overpowering as we have in recent musicals. Its just the right balance of old time and modern time. Its just the right voice of the right actress. This is not another remake of \"Let's Dance\", \"Let's Party\" or \"Let's Not Party\" as those old musicals were.<br /><br />For me I prefer the old Hollywood musicals with it's wonderful singing, dancing and comedy. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I love this movie! I think this is one of those rare cases where the movie gets better as it goes on. I mean, it's not all pure heart... I think she was good at her job since the beginning. She knows how to kill so many people! She is the perfect body to have that body to have that job! She is the only thing that makes the movie better for me!<br /><br />This story has some interesting points as well when she starts to talk and starts to feel her love for him, in a different way. It was interesting to see who she really is, because her \"actors\" were the only thing about her that was good, which made me realize that they were the most evil and stupid character she could come across. But at the same time, it is also interesting how they are so different with each other, and it makes you wonder at how it came to be that way! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I like this film because it is fast paced and easy to follow. I also like that it never goes overboard with graphic violence or sex scenes that we don't get to see often in films. <br /><br />There are a few plot holes\n",

      " the same year, but this is a different sort of dog. Not in the sense that it's really an awful movie, but a movie that is just a mistake. It's an awful movie no one ever will ever see, and that's okay. If this movie gets a lot of attention it's because attention is drawn to it, so it makes absolutely no sense. The story is bad, the acting (especially from the star of the movie is bad), and the storyline is not very good at all. A lot of things have happened between the first and second movie, but what's it that's important? The story is bad, the actors (especially the star of the movie is bad), and the storyline is bad, so it makes absolutely no sense It's a mess, a very messy mess. The music, the cinematography, the dialogs (especially at the beginning is a mess), and the acting, are all very bad. <br /><br />The plot makes no sense. It makes no sense at all. The movie is extremely slow (especially at first). There is no progression of events. Nothing that would make any sense. The movie makes no sense in the first five minutes, and by the time you even think about seeing the movie, there is no reason you should even have seen it in the first place: if you saw this movie and liked it, that means there was no reason you should have even seen it. A mess. <br /><br />Even the soundtrack (mostly music) is bad. For most of the film, there is only one track that is actually listened to. And that's the one track in the movie that is spoken by the main characters, not only during the movie, but also at the end. A mess. <br /><br />The movie is a mess. There is no plot, no real character or interesting story. The movie has no thought that can be done as a film. A mess. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a bad sequel to the best movie \"Robot Jox\" ever made. I am really sad that that good movie has to be ripped apart. I could not wait to see how this sequel of \"Robot Jox\" would re-make itself and go. First, the director is so much better than the director. He used some great sets and actors. But the story is so sad. A young girl with an extraordinary body, no matter what, and a terrible secret. The movie is so sad to see something so promising end. I really hate this movie, so much its worth a 1/10. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I'm a fan of B-movies and of horror as well, so I have a lot of favorites amongst the whole bunch. So the only thing I can ask myself is this. Would you like to see the sequel to \"Deadly Friend\" ? A little bit ?<br /><br />This movie just disappoints me. First of all the actors themselves are not really good, most of them are just average in their role (not mentioning the annoying character). The plot just seems a little vague and is really hard to follow. And the monster look so very different to me.<br /><br />Finally the screenplay is simply a bit too weird and very weird. Just like the music, you simply can not understand this screenplay...<br /><br />So to sum it up, a very strange one with a pretty good looking cast ? _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I just came back from reading an early comment about this film which said the movie will turn you off the right way at the first sight, and that if you can't stand that then let it be a close up of your eyeball, as it is quite a bit weird. To say there will be something in it is the equivalent of saying if your child asks you for something out of the ordinary, say it is strange, then you will try to close it up to the face you just don't need to see where that comes out. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I really like the idea of this film. I think it is a very smart idea for a film to be about a team's quest for glory, and to help others who are on the team. It was great to see two wonderful actors, Ron Perlman and George Clinton having a few laughs together. In addition, the dialogue was great! I really thought it was very clever. It showed the characters being themselves, and that is also important, if one person on the team thinks the way the team wants him to be, then they will win the competition. It also showed a very funny world that the actors were living in, that was funny, but also had a sad side to it. It was sad how they dealt with both the personal and professional aspects of being a professional. I thought\n",

      ", that was another plus was that the film was a spoof, I mean for all the low level comedians out there this is NOT the film! I give it 3 out of 10, i think for a few reasons, firstly i hate to be so harsh on comedies, but it didn't give me the satisfaction of knowing why this was a terrible film, if i was honest to myself.. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ ...it's not that it's bad, but when you expect so much from a film, that's not the point. This isn't really a story about people getting along badly, but about the friendship. The entire movie is about this awkward friend and that awkward friend's friendship, how it evolves and changes, and what happens after that. For a very short film, there is so much we can see, and so much more to be discovered, thanks in large part to the wonderful cinematography and the acting. I give it 7 out of 10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Okay, not really a bad movie, but not really a very good one either. It's not really very interesting either, especially considering the characters in the movie are not really that likable as human beings, if such a thing can be called \"likable\" in movies at least. The characters are really unbelievable and seem like almost cartoon characters, the only good thing about the movie is that it seems to have a decent enough script, at least I think it had. I would give this movie 7 out of 10, if it wasn't for very few of the scenes were just completely unbelievable or just not very interesting at all. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ So the movie \"Koyaanisqatsi\" is about a woman who is out on a journey of self discovery, and who ultimately falls in love with herself, and with the person she was trying to help. While this is a very interesting concept, it is very difficult to pull of as it is very often ambiguous and the story leaves you somewhat feeling confused. I was surprised to find that \"Koyaanisqatsi\" actually had a decent script and good director, considering the fact that this is a true story, with such an incredible subject, and was very impressed with the result. It is a very sensitive movie, dealing with issues of attraction, love versus lust, fear of rejection.<br /><br />The two main actors, in the movie, play against type. One is the sensitive and tender love, while the other is very sensitive and is able to show us clearly what it is he is feeling while showing us that he is feeling no love at all. Both of these characters are very believable because it is the latter who finds out as he slowly comes to terms with the love he has just lost.. This is shown to him in a very personal way that shows through in a very real way. This is shown in a very personal way in a very personal way.<br /><br />This is another really good movie and one that I strongly recommend to anyone who would like to have a good time watching this concept explored in a very real way. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The fact that this film received such a high rating on IMDb is a sad commentary on the state of Australian film industry. The average rating for 2000 - so far - was 9.8! This is astonishing. Perhaps the industry should look at the state of competition in the U.S. or Europe, and see how well studios there are able to develop and foster an environment that encourages honest, talented individuals to seek their own paths.<br /><br />From such a high rating, I'm reminded of another great film that took a similar theme and really made it something very special- this, \"Don't Look Now\", released many years ago by the mighty Victoria.<br /><br />It's the story of a young Australian actress who overcomes the major obstacles to achieving her dream, both financially (as well as emotional and personally in some very challenging circumstances) and successfully makes it to Hollywood. It's not a heartwarming love story in any way, but a fascinatingly honest one.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I had never heard of the story before reading an obit from the New Yorker, based loosely on an actual story. This made it less obvious that the movie would have been very good. However, it isn't the plot that makes the movie so good; it is the excellent acting by the leads. I always like the fact that there is a strong story, even if it has to be in order to tell it. Even when it is not, there is usually a strong plot, even at lower depths.<br /><br />The story is told mostly in the first and last half of the film when the girls are hanging around with Nick (Jason Lee\n",

      " in a film full of wonderful characters or plot. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is just plain annoying! The plot is nothing but lame stereotypes, and the acting and even the script makes me puke!<br /><br />It's actually a good point about the quality of a good comedy on a small budget. At times when there's a surplus of budget in an indie film, it might be nice to have some original ideas...(ie. CASH INSIDE THE PORTABLE)<br /><br />BUT NO!!! This movie is a complete joke - a real loser. The actors and the plot are lame, not to mention, the special effects, music and overall quality of the work is so, so lame. I can't believe they spent the money to produce this! My best advice is to steer clear!<br /><br />I can't believe this movie got produced...!!<br /><br />Please, if anyone has any more, or comment, let me know. Goodbye, dear friends!! I give this movie 3 stars... _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ One of the all time classics. The great Paul Reiser does a bang up job here with an excellent performance all around. He makes us believe it's 1938 when he's being arrested and here is his friend Frank Underwood,who knows what Reiser is really thinking.The problem is that we really don't know the whole real deal with this \"The Lady Chiesa\" story and Frank's having been to several of the Chiesas and Frank's life here in New York when the truth came out would make it even more interesting.<br /><br />Even if I were to just call it a remake of the story, you'd know I mean that as the true story it is as far as I can tell is much more complex than the one they use in the movie. This is not exactly a \"stuffed movie\" either as there is no \"stuff\" or \"chikatastic\" of any kind in \"The Lady Chiesa\" but there is plenty of it to keep you fascinated. Also I would say that the production design is very similar to that of the 1939 version with some very impressive shots of New York. I particularly like the shot of Frank's shoes being dropped on his head as he was handcuffed. That's very stylish. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ As far as I'm concerned this was a waste of 99 cents at the mall. For the first time in my life I saw \"Inspector Clouseau\" on a video store, and I don't see what happened to it. I've seen it several times in the last thirty years or so and I kept getting bored. The plot of the movie is interesting but after a while it went really way beyond belief. The acting is poor even by slasher film standards and the camera work was too dark. The only thing I can recommend this film except for maybe if you're really into \"bad acting\". _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I found this documentary very entertaining. I had also heard good things about it and had read the book and I watched it with my two young sons and they all agreed that they would like to see it because that is what the father did when he was a caretaker for a mausoleum. I would also like to know how they would make a short film about it.<br /><br />The director of the documentary has just finished showing it in the United States and I hope it will be coming out on DVD. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The plot of this movie is simple: it's about a young woman that's had a bad experience in the army, so she goes to a special place with some guys with guns, and the story starts here. I think what I liked most about this movie was that the movie was very realistic. It told us about things that we may not see in everyday life, and I definitely recommend that you see it.<br /><br />It could be a little long due to the fact that it's a movie, it's never too late for an \"alternate reality-thriller\" and everything that is said here may not be true. However, the movie is entertaining, and there's nothing boring about it. I liked what the movie did with setting it in certain parts of the US. I could compare it to some movies that you may not see, such as Gone With The Wind, and that is the way it should be seen on the screen! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie is one of the worst of the 20th Century. It starts slowly, it's got a lot of boring characters, and then it starts to really pick up as a \"realistic\" war movie, in which the protagonists have to fight\n",

      " snuppy, an American hero. The story is a lot of fun, and, because it is one of three \"quaint\" Italian spaghetti westerns made by Nanni Canzoni, it comes recommended. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ After watching the trailer for this movie I had high hopes. The trailer gave the impression of a cheesy, clichéd and shallow film about a creepy old lady who disappears while walking along the beach in the middle of the night. The film starts off with a brief description of the events in the film. An old lady passes by a shop window in the middle of the night, goes into the shallow water and comes out thinking it's the grave of her husband. However the woman finds herself in this predicament as she finds herself followed by a stranger who ends up getting her clothes wet and ends up as well. This film is a shame as it tries to put a twist on the story, which is dull and lifeless. The acting from the leading and supporting players is not convincing and they seem to get carried away trying too hard to make the film well. The direction and screen writing are not up to scratch and the cinematography is shot on a little film no budget video clip. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I found the film very disappointing. While some may consider it an original horror film, I would say this film is more like a TV movie. A very predictable film with a terrible script. It's a shame, because this film is good looking too. In one word I say: Disappointing. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I was at the Preview screening for the Hollywood film \"No One\". I went with a bunch of my friends and we all got bored before the movie started. The first thing that came to my mind was a line in the movie: \"Some people like to play video games too, but they don't do it for themselves.\" While we were all at the movie, I decided to watch it. At first it just didn't make any sense really, the plot seemed to go in a completely different way then from what we had seen. It was like a TV show that was dropped into a film.<br /><br />After the first half an hour we all got bored and decided to fast forward the rest of the way. As a result of the crappy story and dialog, the film was a total disappointment. While watching it I got some of the \"memories\" from other films, for instance I remember the first scene in the movie. At this moment I was wondering if I would really see or hearing a remake of this film. I think, having read the plot from the back of the DVD box I had good expectations. I hope that all good horror/sci-fi films remake good movies, not a \"re-make\" that tries too hard to be different. The remake of this film really did not accomplish that as instead tries too hard to be different. I gave it 3 out of 10 points for it's good looking cinematography, the interesting story and it's gore. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The movie is about this little girls life where she lives with her sister and mother in law. They are always getting in trouble so all they need is a dad. Then comes Robocop and he needs some cash in the bank so he's gonna rob this bank he goes in and tries to rob this bank and all its employees and clients. First of all this movie is terrible its just plain dumb and dumb and stupid. When i saw the movie first i thought it was going to be good and then in a few days when i saw it had improved a bit and got a 2 out 10. I think this film is a waste of good quality film and money. I like to watch a good low budget film just to know that there are still good films out there. Don't see this one because it sucks. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is one of the most entertaining of the many b-movies that came out in the 1950s. There are some pretty good special effects, so it's not totally worthless. All the actors give fine performances. John Garfield looks like a young Laurence Olivier. Walter Connolly and Cynthia Nixon are OK. As for the rest of the actors, they are mostly good, not great. <br /><br />The plot has to do with a group of air raid sirens in the country. Sirens are what people in the US use to notify people about a bomb. If there is any fallout from the bomb on one of those sirens, the president orders a nuclear missile strike. The missile that is launched is not very powerful, so it is pretty stupid for most of the plot. The action that ensues is pretty good, and you have to wonder why they didn't use something a little stronger in this film. I mean, if\n",

      " believe, one who has to have an evil spirit at heart, to be able to create evil in order to dominate the world. No doubt, this \"movie\" is based on a true story. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ When I heard that this movie was on the top 250 of all time of all time, I had to check it out. I'm a big fan of Burt Reynolds, and his movies were great. This movie, while very entertaining, was way too violent. It had a lot of blood and guts, and was in my opinion, too violent to be enjoyed with a group of likeable people. I don't think it was that bad for a straight to DVD movie. The DVD cover and movie description gave me hope. Good job by the DP! It sounded cool! <br /><br />Now I'm wondering, did the producer of this film get paid big dollars to make this stupid film? He made about 30 other movies like this, some of which were pretty good, though this was one of them. So, while some of the negative reviews on this page are valid reasons to not like it, I would still take a pass. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ For an independent release it's amazing how bad this film is -- they must have a good reason for not revealing the ending for this one!! And it's not the first time this has happened -- just the first. I'm only going to state the \"bad guy\" turns out to be more \"depressed\" than the \"bad girl\", despite the \"good guy\" being an actor playing a psychopath. In the film they go so far as to reveal the \"bad guy\" is male, female & gay. And the \"good guy\" is portrayed as a creep. If that wasn't bad enough, just think of the comments he made on this film about his character coming out of remission and being cured of his homosexuality. How many folks get fooled? This was a big mistake. This movie needed to be made. It had no credibility the first time around. I give it 4 stars off of a possible 10. Let's just hope they're honest -- and I mean \"honestly\" in this case. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie, along with some of the shows on this site are amazing!! I saw this movie at the Atlanta Film Festival while I was waiting for my plane ticket. When I got to the movie I was excited to see it. The movie has a good storyline and I liked it and it is funny. It has lots of good actors! You just don't know what all the funny stuff is until they are in the movie together. I enjoyed seeing the actors who played the main two characters, who played well off each other, and also in me like seeing my grandma (who I'm so not fond of) play again, because some of the people who play her in this movie are my age!! So that was fun! I thought the cast of the movie was great I loved the script as well, so it is all made up on the movie. The soundtrack was great!!! I hope the soundtrack will come out soon so I can buy that. The movie is not too heavy on the sound effects and the dialog like in \"Star Wars\" or \"Babylon 5\". I also loved the way they played the actors who just have to be themselves on camera. Very light weight. And what actor wouldn't love a movie with loads of actors looking about 50 or so years younger, and then when they move around and say their lines in that kind of 20's or 30's voice?!! I like to see more funny stuff on these type of sites then when we were in high school. Also I enjoyed watching people in their 20's doing what they would do on a regular basis, rather then going out and getting it on and watching those kinds of movies about teenagers. I like the way this movie goes on long pauses of time, rather than having long monologues. So the story told well and about the fact that you forget how old you are, which I think was important in the movie. I love this movie! I plan to see the movie of this actors again. All in All the movie is an excellent movie and worth seeing!! I give it a 7/10! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I really enjoyed the first one, I saw the new one, and they are pretty amazing. A lot of the movie was in doubt until the end. This movie really kept my interest in a way, almost like a bad remake of \"The Princess Bride\". I think if you have the right music, it can really turn your stomach in to digest the whole thing. Just look at the songs in this movie, \"I Saw a Lawman in a Dress\", and that's all you need to know. Also, the only bad thing about this movie is the\n",

      "VIEWREVIEW_ I just caught this movie on cable and didn't think it was as awful as it appeared to be at the beginning of the movie. It starts great, and I thought it continued well throughout the movie. The plot was pretty dumb in my opinion, but when you think about it all the dumbness is actually justified. If you are looking for some \"screwball\" comedy, then stick with some funny actors. In fact, I guess I should use this line more.....\"I mean come on! We have got to avenge those fools that killed our family, huh!? \" _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ ...for a \"real\" family. You know it, I know it .... and yet ... it never gets serious, is really, totally ridiculous, flat, boring, and overlong. Oh yeah, the ending, the most predictable piece of garbage ever, and the plot twists, etc. (you got me)<br /><br />The one thing, and perhaps the reason why it failed so miserably in my estimation, was the awful music performed by one of the funniest and most incredible band members ever. And there are those who claim he was not good enough to be a singer. Well, give the guy his due for giving us rock's best song. If one would have to guess what the hell was the singer singing -- I think I would have guessed \"I want your baby back\" ...or was it \"We want you back, oh, you want something again!\"? _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I like Steve Railslake. This film is the antithesis, to him on the one hand, as he tries his best to convince a reluctant and anxious Jodie Foster to do what he wants, a job he has longed for but could never attain. He must learn that the real power to get the girl she seeks comes from within herself. This is true movie for those who seek guidance as they seek the answers to their problems. This is a great movie for those who love the art of the heart, the arts of love, the arts of heart. The story was well told but the film was well shot. The performances were great. Steve Railslake looked the part of Steve. My vote .......10 out of 10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I caught this film on late morning TV without the benefit of a good show to begin with. The story, though told a familiar one, and it was, to put it mildly, tiresome. One would think that an actor like Megan Fox would have pulled off such a role- yet she comes up with nothing but some very poor acting skills. This has to rank as a poor effort not to be taken very seriously, but perhaps it was supposed to be funny or at the very least be a bit camp. Well, no it wasn't. Megan Fox's portrayal of a young woman being in love with the man she loves just fails to be funny, and the film makes it look like the director decided to have the romance take place in an old bank building.<br /><br />Well, that is not the only flaw in this movie. There was nothing in this movie that was even slightly memorable. The scenery, of which I like a good many movies, was simply forgettable.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film or even the concept of a \"date movie\" to anyone looking for a good laugh at a poor, predictable one hour and twenty minute excuse for a film. This film was as predictable as they come. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The reason why this film is not higher rated is that it is the modern day version of The Grapes of Wrath and Lawrence of Arabia, yet at the same time, has a much more modern story and pace. This movie has a lot of people sitting and waiting to leave the theater. A lot of it is the older group of people going to see the film in a theater where there is a real possibility of going in. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Wow what a real kick in the pants this movie was! At first I didn't care that this movie was a total ripoff of the original book, but after watching more and more of the movie I just couldn't take it any more. The movie was very good, I'm sorry to say, but the movie is just not worth seeing. I recommend if you go to a movie just to see what is a pretty good movie, then see the movie and decide if you should go with it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ For the life of me I cannot figure why some people hate this movie. I think some people like action, horror, and big-screen soap. If it's in the movie, I like it. If it's on TV, I don't like it. So\n",

Instead it's about the action of people with no souls and nothing in common which is a little too easy to take. You get a lot of movies for a very low price but this one doesn't offer enough for anyone under 30. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ this movie is simply amazing. i have to add that i don't quite understand what kind of people would really enjoy it, and why people would rate it so lowly. i'm not sure that i really understand the whole movie, but i think that it's still an excellent one that i would recommend to friends and family. it's really a shame that it's rated as such a shitty one, because i would definitely rate it higher! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ An American Werewolf in London is the best sequel I've ever seen. It's got a lot of action, a lot of laughs, a lot more drama, and a lot more story... which means we get more of what we wanted from an American Werewolf in London. It also has a lot more fun. I loved the new outfits the girls have, and they were so much better than the ones they wore immediately before. Also there were a bunch of things I wanted to change to make the movie better... but that's what sequels are like, isn't it... it's just the worst I've seen... please don't see it. It doesn't deserve to be the #1 spot on the box with the original. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I first saw the first trailer on this site about 18 months ago, and although I normally love \"little\" sequels to big films (like the second installment of \"The Grinch\n",
      ",\" for example), I found the trailer and promotional copy of this film to be cringe-worthy, so I had high expectations for this one. Then I happened to stumble upon this movie.... and even with my relatively high expectations, I was a bit unprepared for what I would discover. The story (if you could call it that), the dialogue, the acting, the special effects, etc., upon which I give it my highest praise, all came together in a way that made it exactly what I expected it to be. I didn't expect to much from \"Little\" Carrie, but I, thankfully, didn't pay too much attention to my fellow reviewers, and I must say that this film is one of the first that kept me watching for the full two hours, even though I shouldn't have been subjected to the unnecessary tears. I can't even say that it was one of the most heart-warming, or memorable movies I have ever seen. The storyline is simple: Carrie's favorite zombie slacker boyfriend, Todd (Luke Wilson), inherits a mansion from his deceased brother, Mike, who was possessed by the zombie. Todd starts a new job and Carrie gets pregnant immediately. The couple also learns that being pregnant isn't exactly a guarantee for happiness, especially when that your zombie boyfriend starts off getting married! The film is not exactly light on the romances and friendships, especially not for someone such as Todd to fall in love with. However enjoyable the film was.... it still makes me feel very awkward at times. I did really like Carrie's dialogue and especially Wilson's direction in the film. But even though I did like the story and the acting, I found this film to be somewhat slow-moving and the special effects to have a little too much computer-generated animation! I know it's supposed to be a \"scream\" film, but I felt I was watching a computer-generated animated film that I would be embarrassed to use! I do realize that the computer-generated effects are used often to very good effect, but they should at least have a minimal relationship to the story and acting. And I have to say that I did not mind the amount of computer-generated violence in this film. When I've seen films that rely more heavily on computer-generated violence to create suspense, such as Hellraiser: Judas Priest, I have to say that computer-generated violence is sometimes surprisingly good at creating and maintaining a creepy atmosphere. And a lot of films rely on computer-generated violence in the wrong end. In Hellraiser movies, such as the first two sequels of \"The Rage\" trilogy (the first, Paranilla) and the third film of \"The Resurrection\" trilogy (the second, \"Enter the Dominions\"), the violence is usually computer-generated in the right hand. Sometimes it's a good idea to take a film like \"The Grace of The Ghost\" and create a movie that relies more on acting, dialogue, the story, or the visuals. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The screenplay, the acting, and the casting in this film show why you should never let an indie film made on such a shoest\n",

      " part with him to stop his evil plans. The rest of the film chronicles his life, with flashbacks allowing us to see many of the events of his life. From here, we are introduced to the antagonist, a woman played, unfortunately, by Anil Kapoor who seems to be his only real (and perhaps only?) redeeming quality. This film shows all the strengths of a good musical such as \"Booth's Eye\" or \"The King of Masks\" and at the same time, it doesn't come off so cheesy that it becomes silly. I'm not sure what Ms. Kapoor is trying to say here, but I can tell it's probably \"Love conquers all.\" _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A story of survival in a postapocalyptic world. The acting was pretty bad, to be honest. Especially by the main female character (who only speaks twice throughout the entire film. Can she figure out the third act?) But it wasn't all bad, I did enjoy watching the movie. It was quite atmospheric and the special effects were impressive for an 80ish movie (I usually love Wes Craven's movies, but he doesn't always make good post apocalyptic horror). The ending was disappointing because everything had been told before, yet it still managed to keep the viewer entertained. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I enjoyed this movie very much. The acting was incredible, the storyline was strong, and the ending was awesome. I will admit that there was no dialog in the movie, and that I thought that the ending left a little to be desired, but I nevertheless enjoyed this movie very much. I was surprised, that it was rated G. I do not normally give movies that high a rating, however this one deserved the extra one. All I can say is, \"Enjoy The Ride\". This is yet another great sequel. Go see it when it is on any of the big chains. There was some bad language in this film (I do not know why it was rated G since it is completely fair), but this is no big deal. Overall, I did enjoy the movie. I will not give away what happens, because I feel that is not important. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I watched the trailer of this movie years ago, and it looked good. The cover looked cool and scary, so I thought I would go rent it. I rented it, the first night I did. It scared me good. I've seen my fair share of horror, and I had my doubts, but I had a change of heart the night my roommate got attacked by the Tooth Fairy. I've heard a lot about this movie on here, so I went out for it the next day, and I was more scared that any night was. It's true... this movie is extremely creepy, because it presents the main character as evil in the movie. When my roommate woke up and looked exactly the same as she did the night she got attacked, I knew what was going on. The Tooth Fairy is a unique, scary monster, and it may give you some extra nightmares with your roommate, but it certainly isn't good for the good of the soul. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This show is great. I'm a huge fan of western movies, and \"Canyon Joe\" is one of my favorites. I watched the original western on PBS a lot back in the 40s, and it was as great as it gets. It's a shame they don't release it on DVD anymore, because I've seen the series run on PBS a few times, and if they never air it again, it would be worth the purchase. The western scenes are great, and the location footage is awesome. Then, of course, there is the western music. John Wayne sounds great in his own right. Glenn Ford and Glenn Quinn were the kings of the west, and the whole western genre was dominated by them, so they were the kings. John Wayne's role in \"Canyon Joe\" is excellent, and his character is so well-written that it takes you into this young westerner's world. The supporting roles are great as well, and you really see the importance of this western. All in all, this is a well made series, as good as it gets. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This TV series is one of the best British film I have seen in years. The writing is amazing, the acting is great, and the camera-work amazing! I was really impressed by how well it really turned out. Its a shame that there are very few episodes available, I would buy the whole series on DVD, as I find it very very valuable. The story it's a great one, and is made very true to life! I'm very interested to see this series released on DVD, I would buy it, I can't wait to watch it next week\n",

      ", it isn't bad, but the story is slow and hard to follow.<br /><br />If you still believe that this film is the worst film ever made, or are curious to see how bad it is, just stick with the first four films in the series: Death in Botswana, Jumanji, and the remake of The Sixth Sense.<br /><br />In the first two films, Botswana is in the midst of a violent revolt. On the same day, a plane carrying the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the oldest of the modern medical marvels crashed in Botswana. The doctors on board are all dead, but the civilians are still worried about being eaten by a large animal on the grounds that it might not survive long. So the Queen goes off to discover and bring them to safety! This time, she comes across a farmer named John Parker that has just killed his wife. The next day the villagers of the town are attacked by a group of hooded men. Despite the pleading of the farmers, Parker tries to escape with his daughter, Elizabeth (the nurse Sherwin-Williams), to see if he can find the surviving people alive.<br /><br />Of course, the farmer kills all of the men, but Parker goes after the farmers. In the next scene we see Parker and the farmer escape again as the hooded men begin to tear down their farm. In the third scene we see Elizabeth escape from the hooded soldiers and eventually meet up with Parker again, who is helping her to bring the town people to safety. The last scene we see Parker bring the people back safely with the aid of a walker which has been placed on the roof of his barn.<br /><br />The end of the film is probably the most disappointing one. If you are a fan of the first two films (\"The Visitation\" and \"Sister\") and want more of that movie adaptation, I don't think you would be disappointed. In the past, we had more episodes of \"Cabin Fever\" than any other Howard Gordon Lewis film, which means that I cannot recommend this film very often.<br /><br />Grade: D+ _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film shows up in the IMDb review with more bad comments, less positive reviews. The plot is ridiculous and the characters unappealing. Even the scenery is not that impressive though. If there is one positive thing to say about this film there is the scene where the \"young\" kid in the wheelchair who is trying to run and often times jump out of the way of the paraplegia are able to run about an acre/foot long farm. That is one heck of a farm though. Other than the scene I was most irritated at this film was at that one man driving a car who could turn a 360-degree bank angle, run through a car jack & be fixed. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The story line is interesting and the acting is good but the story line is what sucks. I could not connect with the character, I got no reason to like or care for them and the story just dragged on & on & on. It would have been better if I would have understood what they were about, if I was good I would have continued to watch it. The only thing that was left to my imagination was a young woman trying to find her sister and find out who was in the store and that was it. I did like the one person, the older boyfriend, who kept his job and paid for the gas. I also liked when he saved the day, when the woman saw his old girlfriend. He also got me to pay attention to the guy who was taking the store v.s. the men in black gloves & black coats in the corner of the shop. He got into a few batman action w/o his clothes on (I do like black gloves but they don't bother me.) _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The story may be that, on his way home from the Vietnam War, Ben's brother Jeff comes home to him in his battered car.<br /><br />\"Why were you driving away from me when you guys were in the middle of nowhere?\" Jeff asked his son shortly before Ben's suicide.<br /><br />\"Yeah, I was just going'e there to see if he'd call the cops,\" Ben's mother recalled.<br /><br />The story of their friendship is played out in the film. But I think it was more like a love story, with Jeff helping Ben escape from a chain gang.<br /><br />I think director Richard Wilson could turn this into more of a drama, which would've at least kept me.<br /><br />7/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In this sequel to his 1962 film, \"My Summer Story\", director John Madden (SUNNY, DOGS,\n",

      " aged in the 1940's. At first, I thought this was a sci-fi film, that is until I watched this wonderful documentary. It was made by an entire family, obviously. I found the film as wonderful as I hoped it would be. You have to remember that the production staff was not taking its eyes off a subject, it was just the people who made this film. And that is absolutely true, I am sure the children of the original. Their parents who they can point to and say, \"We were a real part of this movie and we're all proud of it. What's good? A real story.\"<br /><br />I don't mind what the adults think. I think it is just kids acting like that. But the music is. I can't say enough. It's pure music at its finest. It is the only soundtrack that I can think of that I did not want more than a 2 star rating. Even though this movie was made in the 40's, it will always end up in the top 10 list of my collection. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is by far one of the funniest and original movies I have ever seen. It was so bad that it came down hard. It is filled with hilarious actors as well as the most bizarre villains of all time. The movie starts out a little slow, but quickly steals the show. A new boss is brought in, not as bad as it first seems, he has the chance to wipe out all of the competition. However the bad guy's daughter gets on his bad behavior, and so he must be wiped out for good. I think the best part is the ending, but for me the \"I want my time back\" scene may have been the most hilarious part of the movie. One thing that I have to admit that the movie does have is a little slow motion for some scenes but its okay. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was very displeased with this film. It does not do justice to the book. A fine cast, excellent script, great photography: why didn't just make a movie that really takes the \"dark\" route? <br /><br />The story itself is full of moral ambiguities -- as for example, in the final scene, when the young doctor gives his impassioned speech to the police inspector, who turns out to be the more restrained and professional version of the doctor, we see that the speech is just a mask. How can that be, when the doctor has a ten-fertilized arm and knows that he is capable of bearing great weight by himself? In a sentence, he is saying that he is \"amazed\", and if that is so, he probably should not have said those words. But I didn't buy it. <br /><br />On the contrary, I wanted to feel sorry for the old guy, but at the same time feel sympathetic, because his attitude throughout the film -- that everything is for him -- is so completely at odds with real life (and in this movie, with no sympathy, with so many plot holes, that he is just a very bad guy indeed). I was also bored with the speech by the doctor, because every two lines he delivered made me feel sorry for him, but no other way to describe it. In this way it is hard to tell whether the movie was a statement of moral superiority, or an homage to the French tradition -- for example, I don't want to see the same director (Le Dernier Combat to compare) making another one.<br /><br />On the plus side, the movie was so dark, so difficult (as in real life), and the screenplay (by Philippe Huyenz) made it impossible to have a nice, sunny Saturday afternoon. I don't mind bad movies, but I really dislike them -- because I feel a little bit like a lost cause when they are made, because even at $9.99, they are too damn expensive, because they are just too damn fastidious, and I wish to leave the world a little better off than they got it into. One can understand the urge to put that profit center in the form of a \"book,\" because you could save a lot of time, money, effort, etc. by just putting the entire story on paper, and leaving it at that.<br /><br />I feel like the director did an injustice to the book (or at least tried to). Because he's been proven that he only wrote two novels to show off how great the French, and I think anyone can read one from memory, by just reading. Otherwise at least the narrator is clearly able to relate to the story. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The film suffers horribly from its start, a plot which has been done to death, not one iota of characters and dialogue that was even remotely entertaining... the story follows a little-\n",

      ", we see that they are only a part of the picture. Of course, the big question is still: where did the children get their parents, as it relates to the tragic situation at the time of their birth? _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I have to say , this movie was a good movie. It was a good story but to much action in it. They had more action in a movie like Death Wish 2, but I don't think this story was that bad. I mean the movie was very good, I only liked the first one, and that's because I wanted to see the sequel, but I didn't get my wish. This movie was better as the first but it still had plenty of action in it. All in all, my favorite movie. Don't watch this movie thinking you got it by renting some crap. I think you'll like it.<br /><br />My rating: B <br /><br />Rated R for some violence but it's well worth the viewing. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In a scene with a gun, we can see an actress' (Denise Breslin) face and body shot multiple times. That's just one of countless films shot with a gun--we can see the scene more than once. The movie, however, makes no mention of the gun or what it does to people (or the audience) it's shot. The plot of the film seems to be something about revenge, which is never developed. While not as original as it's predecessors, this was made in 2005--and we can only surmise from this film that it's not going to take itself seriously.<br /><br />While the character of the femme fatale may be interesting on certain levels, the whole movie is more of a shot-em-up--and the direction of shooting is very sloppy. A lot of the actors do a good job with what they have, but a real problem is that it's impossible to feel any of it--we can only feel the camera shake and recoil when we're in the exact spot. The direction lacks coherence and doesn't provide the best opportunities to be in the same space, nor does it provide the greatest opportunity to be shot in the same position, as one is shot, and shot. Everything seems random--there are at first scenes that are interesting and then then they falter or get lost in the fog. We don't feel any of the characters when we are in the exact locations they were shot in. The acting is very poor and the plot is terrible, but you've got to give it credit. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ As long as you allow yourself the luxury of having an imagination that exceeds what a television- or DVD-release medium can give, and not looking at all the usual preconceptions or notions that a person might have while watching the program, you are in for a treat. However, if you want to see what you have seen or not, this is a seriously bad show. The best way to describe it is like a good 'school' drama show--no plot, high drama, lots and lots of talking, and a lot of 'plotting'. To be honest; it's not as if there aren't a lot and plenty of shows out there that are a little more 'flawed' to the point of ridiculousness. In general, I'm not going to go into this show because the story is so stupid, but I'll sure leave there the right side of the table. When something has happened (in this case, a really odd accident) and then happened (in the case of \"The Young Frankenstein\"), the movie starts. And that this something happening never occurs. This shows we've been lied to by the writers and the producers, just like most show movies put forth those two sidekicks, and they never give us any insight or reason to actually care about the main characters. The show was bad, but also seemed to try to make up for the lack of anything going on in the plot by using the same gimmick every time a new plot twist was revealed. That's just lazy. Also, to make it short; it is simply not entertaining at all and only serves to bring the whole thing down. Not even a very watchable episode can be said about \"Young Frankenstein\" since the acting wasn't even worth mention as they clearly had no real cause to even be on set. I would recommend you to spend the next few days watching a video instead. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Okay, I admit that \"The Perfect Storm\" is no masterpiece, so it's not a big waste of resources if you can sit through the film's entire running time without falling asleep. There are a couple of good things about the film. First, the plot is not as contrived as it was in the novel, and the second of all,\n",

      " seems to just skip right in between. The one thing that I never can get past is that the only way to enjoy the movie, is to leave your brain at the door. There is very little left to the imagination, so if you can, stay well clear. What is left looks like garbage. I would say if this is a movie for you, you might want to leave your brain at the door. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ What can I say after I say the one line summary. Well I am the guy that rented this movie and I actually wanted to see the movie so bad. At the end of the movie I laughed almost through the entire movie. The plot has to do with a woman who's a virgin and her guy friends who are all wannabe stud. I mean come on! How do these people with millions can't find a stud? I mean the man is that hot and he just got \"dumped\" by his wife. Why? And why is she not mad at him? And isn't it obvious that his wife is getting horny and has the hots for all of them? The movie was so predictable and there were so many things that made no sense. The whole movie is just boring. The first three were great but then the fourth was just some low grade sexual innuendo and this is a little better. So when you rent this, watch a great movie such as The Sixth Sense or Something about Mary. Stay well clear!!! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I'm not even gonna waste time on this, other then some lines. I'm just gonna let other people do some damage that I shouldn't have had to pay attention to. The plot is kinda lame and pretty bad. There isn't any plot. I mean, it's kinda like something out of the mid-00s' but I haven't seen that. So, the movie kind of had me just holding my hand over my eyes and thinking \"oh, that's the movie...then the scene will appear but you just can't see it\"...it wasn't all terrible like I thought it was suppose to be. I suppose you could say they went with the old style of editing, sound and lighting so that when the phone rang, it would ring in the hotel room(or wherever the place was and just what kind of party they were going to) or whenever anyone would have something to eat they would just get up and go to the fridge to drink on their way to their date. And oh, by the way, no one was arrested. Maybe it was just some kind of prank to see if the audience would not notice...<br /><br />As I looked at it on my 5 year old monitor, I was saying to myself, \"Why are the characters not screaming when they walk through doors?\" Maybe I missed something important or something, but I was thinking \"Oh, they are just making something out of nothing\", but it just seemed like they wanted to take the fun out of the movie by showing everything in one fast flashback: a party is a storm, a party is a party, someone is having a party, someone is hitting on somebody...etc, whatever .......<br /><br />You could easily make the same point about other movies also with the same plot but with different actors playing different parts. That kind of nonsense...I bet the director was thinking something like \"let's take another trip on the cruise ship and just have a story set in that\". But some of those ideas were better....<br /><br />Well, maybe next time I'll borrow some money to buy a high-quality video of the movie. I'd really like to watch it again...3/10 _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I've seen a handful of short films starring Marge Simpson and many have been made, most notably her and Tim Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland\". Both are fine actors and both are wonderful in movies and shorts. \"HAPPY MODE\" stars Lisa Zanesa as Simpson's mother in the film, played by a beaming Melissa Rauch who gives her all in portraying Simpson's mom. As Simpson's character, Zanesa wins a promotion with the department when she attends dance class. She works in a department store trying to sell her family shoes and the department helps her improve her character and skills. After the school dances, her mother learns that there is a problem in the store, a girl has stolen the shoes that they were trying to sell. Her character can't return and she's sent to the city's most dangerous location - Mice Island. She escapes and is arrested by the \"B\" Division of the police department.

      " left up as an excuse (so to speak) to rush things along.<br /><br />Beware of any movie that claims to be an adaptation. The only way you can tell the difference between this and a typical movie is if you have seen the first 15 minutes of the movie and know the names of the leading actors. I have been assured that this was a movie made for TV because the characters do not have names they are playing. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I really love this game!! Everyone that has played it, the more you get into it the more you fall in love with it. I play it to work the stress out of me and just be challenged all the time! I don't take this game seriously but just find it fun to play with friends on a rainy day. I have played many many different Mario games but never my favorite. I hope this game is out on the NES (no U.N.) because I have gotten so much in the store on this game. You play as Toad for Bowser. And as other people have mentioned he is the most evil character. There are lots of bosses for Bowser, Luigi and even a final boss! Bowser is one of my favorites. I also love Namin (Shadow Mario). He has the weirdest hat he can think of that keeps him from showing his true form. And Mario's friends (Luigi's friends from Animal Forest and Bowser's friends from Super Mario Galaxy)! The story is great also. And there are new Super Mario characters like Cheats (a cheat who can talk) and even a cheats friend (Luigi's friend!). Some new levels as well! Also you get to play a new Toad called Paper. And you get to save Princess Peach. Great game, my favorite game of all time. If you loved Dark Star then Dark Star will touch your heart and leave you wanting more of a good time. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If ever there was a film made concerning a group of children who lived through the worst thing that could happen in their lifetime, it surely would be \"The Bothersome.\" This film would be good for one or two young adults.<br /><br />The story is about nothing particularly good and about half a dozen extremely clichéd situations where the writers would have us believe that we can all be a great group of children out on a freezing frozen lake somewhere. But because most of the film doesn't develop this plot into a meaningful movie it is all the better for its lack. The characters are flat, the story is bad, and the ending isn't too different from any other Disney film of its time.<br /><br />The characters are stupid, the weather is stupid, the characters are stupid, the story is bad, and the ending isn't too different from any other Disney film of its time. This movie makes the majority of Disney films at least a little worth watching. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It has been a good year. This is not a good film so be prepared for a fall from the sky (or two) and a low 6-9 rating from a lot of the sites in the world _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The first time I ever saw a picture be the epic that it was (The Lord of the Rings was one), I just wanted to go crazy and say how cool it was! I was addicted before I saw the amazing \"Cinema Paradiso\" with Mark Hamill (who did amazing work with me in the '40's) and John Rhys Davies, a great actor who's now gone to show his acting talents to the rest of the world (A special thanks for that), which was the beginning of a series, \"The X-Files\" with Bryan Fuller and Darryl Hannah, which is now in my home office.<br /><br />Now to this new one called \"X-Files.\" I was a huge fan of \"The X-Files\" but this new show is terrible! I mean not once do I believe that these guys are experts in anything, they're just \"oh yeah\" type actors trying to pull off an \"X-Files\" type scenario! And this is very irritating! \"X-Files\" fans: buy the series, not the new one. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ OK, the premise is bad, and it's not really the story, it's the whole atmosphere around it.<br /><br />But... the music is always effective, the scenery lovely, yes, and the acting is... OK. Now I could say that this is one of those movies that you have to hate when you watch it and when you know it was on TV, but somehow I feel sympathy for the main characters - the two main ones. I'm a die-hard Gillian Anderson fan that has seen all her supporting roles, and I hate\n",

So, let's add in a little sex, and we're on to the recipe for a happy, entertaining movie, yum yum.<br /><br />To be fair and balanced, I also wanted to give this movie some credit - it certainly has its fair share of clichés and plot holes, and it did manage to at least make me laugh a little at the expense of the usual clichés. That said, this is absolutely not among the top ten worst movies I've ever seen. But it couldn't have been, could it? If you want a good laugh at the expense of the usual clichés, go and see \"Planet of the Apes\" - but only after you've seen the top 10 movies of all time.<br /><br />A few spoilers ahead....<br /><br />Oh, and the epilogue is pretty bad too.<br /><br />Just in case you're wondering who the hero is (okay, I'm kidding, but you get the point)...<br /><br />The plot... OK, I don't want to spoil anything, but there's something of a surprise at the end of this movie, and you've probably seen it a hundred times already. That's not a bad thing, really. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ To sum this up, this movie sucks.<br /><br />It looks like it was made within a couple of days, and it's horribly uneven. The sound is really bad, and the dubbing is equally as awful. And the whole ending is... ugh.<br /><br />The best part would be the first 20 minutes of the film, when the girl is in bed and she's just a makeup<<br /><br />Then they get to the subplot of the murder and it's just a guy and a girl getting it on.<br /><br />All in all, it's not worth seeing.<br /><br />Just skip it.<br /><br />And if you do buy it, make sure it's for Christmas, or whatever. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ For anyone still reading here, I just saw the film for the first time last night. Not having watched this years prior to this one, I was not ready for a film so I'm not prepared for the level of acting this one will offer.<br /><br />This is NOT a romantic comedy. This is an action film featuring a romance and comedy.<br /><br />The film is about two brothers, Ben (Ben Chaplin) and Ben (Danny DeVito) whose lives revolve around football. Ben runs for mayor but his attempts to woo a girl named Lacey (Liv Tyler) lead to Ben missing his chance to make it in the game, a problem as Lacey can be the one that wants Ben a woman.<br /><br />This is a great film with fine acting with the comedy part of the story really funny and even though there is a very basic plot and plot outline, this was still a great movie that many will enjoy. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie is one of the dumbest I've seen, though the idea itself may sound good. \"Sally Field\" (Sally Field, another one of my favorites) is a spoiled girl who wants money from a girl next door (and the way she treats every guy she meet), so her big brother, \"Matt Field\" (Brian Field), runs a casino with the money. Matt wants to claim the money, but Sally Field has doubts about him. A lot of crazy things occurs throughout the movie--like Matt running a fever and getting knocked down multiple times by the big brother, \"Big\" Ben; Matt and Sally trying to sleep in front of a moose; Matt getting stung by ants; a moose that got in a big way and is now terrorizing the area; Matt getting rid of an egg--and Matt, who is really evil in a whole bunch of ways, beating up moose; a monkey stealing a moose's eggs and laying them; sleeping with a moose; Ben and \"Big\" Ben having sex; Matt, Sally, and \"Big\" Ben throwing moose; a monkey eating sheep; a moose; big brother getting beaten up; Matt getting eaten; and plenty more.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely horrible--and the effects are even worse--like the moose's stomach getting bigger and bigger and the moose getting eaten--why would anyone want to waste their time watching this? Plus, one big dumb scene features Ben talking to a redneck about getting laid, and then in the next scene we see a moose getting eaten, followed a bit later by the redneck. That was the funniest scene, I think.<br /><br />So, if you want to laugh\n",

      " this movie, I would recommend that you see this movie before it comes out, you will not be sorry. The acting is good and there are some surprising scenes, but the plot makes no sense at all and at no point do you understand what truly happened. My hope is that one day movies like this will not exist. I'd like to send my condolences to all of the actors involved in this movie. There were very few scenes that resembled real life except the few that were with Mr Cox in a dream and his words at the end were so sad I could feel no emotion. This movie is disgusting..I am not a dream expert to see it and I can not imagine anyone liking it..I only could have liked the ending if it was as surprising as a movie. It would have otherwise left a great impression. I loved the look of this movie: Mr Cox has a perfect body, all is perfect with him and he dresses like a boy and seems to have everything in the world covered over. And it is said that he keeps everything under his blanket. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ So what exactly is the deal with all the bad reviews for this movie? Let me tell you a little something about my family. We are from Greece as an island nation. We love movies from abroad (or at least from other European countries), and we know a pretty decent movie when we see one.<br /><br />The problem with \"Portrait of a Lady in Fear\" is that it is an absolutely horrible movie, and most of the people on this website (including the makers of the movie) really wish that it would do better. But as you know, it doesn't.<br /><br />If they had been clear at the beginning of the movie, it would have been fine. But the plot is so terrible that it makes even the people who love it completely bitter. I was enticed by the fact that there was a slight possibility that the story would improve, but unfortunately it didn't. The story is so badly written that you must feel sorry for both the director and the actors when they were forced to act in this waste of celluloid. What a waste of money, I tell you that. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I must say that I am a huge fan of the original and I was very displeased with the remake of this film. The original was so very well written and well acted and I was looking forward to a modern day Robin Hood action flick. However, this film was NOT a tribute to the original. Instead, it was a poor portrayal of Jackie Earls and Colonel Doubtfire with the exception that the two crooks were given decent, heartfelt, and even professional debacles. This film was very poorly written, badly acted and with its two principal characters portrayed as nothing more than mere b-comedy fodder. The only thing that was decent about this film was that it made me think twice about committing adultery with any of the ladies in the film. But that, and the fact that this film had a few moments of fairly decent suspense, were obviously sacrificed in order to please the hokey-sounding \"American audience.\" A thoroughly awful film. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ After a long hard week,I had a truly fun evening of viewing the magnificent BBC adaptation of Susan Hills' fascinating, clever, yet riveting \"Dollman\".All the way the acting is spot on,And Sally Hawkins' brilliant direction in capturing all the mood and the music.....the show is simply amazing!!!!I cant wait to watch the whole series again.......and to see how the series pans out to a final series DVD.......all of the actors give brilliant,professional performance, and this BBC production is no exception.....Bravo!Bravo! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie is worth watching again. It's not \"Mork and Mindy\" or \"Woof\". It's not both. It's not \"Catwoman\". It's very different from its contemporaries. Not a big fan of the books, but I loved this movie enough to keep reading them to try to figure out what the hell they were going for. I loved the ending so much, I actually kind of cared about the catwoman's choice. It was the clearest indicator of their different approach to the books. If you love the Catwoman stuff, you'll like this movie. If you have a good appetite for quality independent films, I'm afraid you will probably want to pass on this one.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I read that a year ago, and I have not been able to find anything in a title bar the IMDb user rating of 8.9 yet I am now in the company of people who were on this site and felt completely lost when the movie ended.<br /><br />I hope to find a\n",

      " the first time I was a huge fan of the original Star Trek Series. I would not have been able to aspired to enjoy \"In a Mirror\" (as I'm still trying to watch that) as much as I have in other Star Trek Series. However, this latest series, managed to please me greatly and am now in possession of the complete third series in the Star Trek universe (even though it's in different moulds and has different colour schemes). I loved the whole 'paranormal' vibe of it, the whole 'secret government' idea like the 'Matrix' or The X-Files. <br /><br />It's not without its problems, the casting is usually very rough. I am still not sure who Patrick Stewart is, but it is fair to say that every actor in Hollywood today is more like Michael Caine than Peter Lorre. If Caine ever asked me to write a novel, I would. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a bad example to show your kids. I really think that the producers and director did not give a good name to a good organization. The main actor was very weak and there is not one funny or touching scene in the whole movie. The whole movie was a waste of almost 90 minutes. The bad acting was a main problem. The acting was pretty bad in some scenes and terrible in others. I think that the worst one was the music. There was no music to make a happy mood nor to make the movie a memorable picture. If it was not a football movie maybe it would be better but it wasn't. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Not that I have anything against the Muppet movies but when you look at Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Rowlf, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem and the various live shows from WINK-DAT, well, I just don't see the point in making a film when you can just write a one-line summary in the synopsis box! I mean come on! It's a film! Two of the best songs in history are played and it's awesome! This is why films are important and you shouldn't just show something when you can do no wrong. I'm saying don't bother with this film! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I was at the premier a couple weeks ago in Toronto and saw a very young Jim Carey walking around the theater. I stopped a second later and realized he was still there and hadn't died. I had never heard of him being ill and I wondered if he was doing OK. I had the sense that he had been discharged from the hospital (Pentagon) and wondered if he would survive the trip back to Chicago.<br /><br />About 20 years ago I worked as a producer on several Air Force One and Two Star War films. I recall the usual: a pretty talented cast can only put forth so much energy and excitement on their faces and then they get relegated to fairly boring films.<br /><br />One is entitled 'Lone Wolf and I' and stars a very young Jim Carey as a Private (and, yes, gay) Air Force One pilot. A young and healthy Jim manages to keep the world guessing about his suicidal feelings until his buddies (the F-16 pilots and one woman) lead him to it.<br /><br />A few things about this film, a lot has been said about the great performances by Carey and the rest of the cast. It is a pity because this is certainly a very promising film. Carey is at his best here. And the ending was so true to life it was difficult to watch. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The only reason I was in the theater was that it was the only movie going-out movie left and I wanted to see it. So I went to a cinema, saw it and I fell in love with it. I got it on both cheap VHS and DVD and I have never seen it but I am sure I'll like it some day. Maybe I just get this kinda stuff by mistake.<br /><br />This is a very simple story about a little girl who has a bad and sad daddy and his family. He doesn't have many friends and most of all his family are not really nice to him and seem more cruel than he is. The mother says that she has a right to be cruel and the daughter says that she doesn't have a right to be nice to anyone.<br /><br />She cries out for her daddy and everyone in her life is sort of cruel to her.<br /><br />This movie is a beautiful story and the best movie I ever saw. The scenes are very few and far between and make this a great film.<br /><br />This movie is a little bit different from other melodrama' in that there's not violence and there is no big fight.

      " the time. Just before the opening credits come on the television screen, he's running down the hallway yelling \"Hey, I saved the day!\" and the song plays. The theme is so bad, it's played over the end credits. It's the theme song of a bad movie, I guess it brings the right message. I know, it's the message...stay away from these films. Don't watch any more. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This story is about the last surviving member of the crew of the ill sunk Titanic, leaving behind an ill-fated friendship. As the ship approaches death, the crew discovers that a tragedy has befallen. The people of 1756 on the other shoe hop to the dark world outside of the sea. The only constant in their friendship and the only connection with anyone, all on the Titanic is loss.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film with a few memorable scenes. The only problem that I had was that for several minutes I couldn't see the end credits (or the end credits for the American made Titanic) because you were looking through the teary black and white lenses. My initial feeling is that the end credits had some sort of big mast, something that got the film out of the theatre with the right amount of drama. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie has the best acting since \"Oliver!\" in my opinion, with John Goodman's performance as Mr. Goodtime, you will have the best lines from the film, it's worth the watch! <br /><br />It's worth seeing, just to see Mr. Goodtime, and the rest of the cast at the height of their popularity. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"The Box of Delights\" is a wonderful movie that you can sit down and watch and enjoy at any time of the year. It has a lot of humour in it as it deals with some pretty serious subjects and you can really get into the movie if you like the more realistic view of life in the urban ghetto. There really isn't any better time to watch it and you definitely will. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ this movie is absolutely horrible, the story is about a woman who gets a job working for a family who needs her to help clean-up their abandoned, torn down building from the old black hole in their backyard. there is a lot of cheesy lines in this film, and a lot of pointless scenes, the acting is beyond awful. the only good things about this film, are the little jokes here and there, like the \"I love you's\" in the bathroom scene are stupid, and so is the stupid scene in the police station, the jokes are also very cheesy. I am only thinking about this film because i am a bit of a fan of Jim Carrey and this is the only movie i have seen him in, i think he is good, and i love him in this film! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ ...but let's not pretend like we understand our heroes. This is a tough film to watch, but I managed, nonetheless, to appreciate the subtle humour, that really should, simply mean more than \"Art\" to the young Japanese creators. The problem of a Japanese film wanting to be and being accepted in the West is a fact acknowledged but obscured, in my opinion, in this film. The two stories are connected in some way, yet they are not and cannot be reduced in isolation. As the viewer, I found the films to be well told and have interesting characters, with excellent voice work, and great acting, even though I did not speak Japanese. I was hoping for the westernised versions of both to be equally good, that will be a surprise.<br /><br />I also appreciate the contrast of visual detail here, as the viewer is forced to deal with the fact that they are in the same place. I had to deal with the idea that the viewer has seen the world from above, but I guess that it is a little hard to handle. Some characters are hard to follow - it's not that hard to understand a great deal of the plot. The characters are well drawn, and they have interesting backstories - though the story line is not all that compelling.<br /><br />I hope that to some it will provide an entertainment value for people in Japan, though it was not my experience. I am not an expert at Japanese film making, but I feel that it would have helped the film's story to stay in focus as it will not be getting the attention in the West that you might want to give it by being a Japanese version of another Asian experience. Though, I am not sure I do not mind the fact that a non-Japanese audience will not figure out much of the Western parts. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I read about this\n",

      " which the film fails to engage. What makes it so forgettable is the acting, which is on a par with the other titles. The characters are not believable, and they are not likable. Even Leonardo the elephant, the film's star attraction, suffers from a lack of chemistry with the film's two leads. The only thing the movie has going for it is the beautiful color cinematography. That may be appealing to some. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is the worst movie I have seen in my entire life, and I've watched about twenty-five movies in my life. My wife watched it last night on our Dish. The movie begins as usual: boy has a crush on girl. He comes home from school, they exchange pleasantries, he asks her out, they spend a few days together, boy has a baby, girl's father quits his job, etc., etc. Then boy meets up with girl again, they spend a few months together, boy is jealous, girl misses him, etc., etc. BOY starts going out with her best friend. The movie goes on. Boy wins girl's heart. The end. I know that all this is very predictable, and even if it wasn't, I still wouldn't recommend this movie. What bothered me the most, however, was the fact that the director failed to give the viewer a reason to watch the movie. (And I do mean \"why,\" because there is nothing whatsoever to give a reason.) The acting, in my opinion, was the worst I've ever seen. Boy and girl just don't talk or talk any more. Maybe they should have got divorced, but they keep bumping into each other like j-posts. What a waste. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is an absolutely bizarre film about a couple who set out to be the Pirate Bluffs and have the luck to stumble across a huge stash of stolen movie made-for-the-thousand years ago. The pair has been searching through old film libraries for centuries now for such a particular release but eventually find out that someone has pilfered the whole stash and is releasing it for the highest bidder. Oddly, they find that the real object of their lust is a very modern movie- making machine. A sexy blonde who has an extra layer of sexiness is stealing the film for a local movie theater who just happen to have the whole reel just finished so much that they believe they would win. What makes this film a bit crazy to me is that it was made during the same time period! This means that the couple somehow had to come to terms with a completely modern and fast changing Hollywood film that was a big step down from the original film (1933)and, yet, it is still a beautiful and intriguing piece of work. It is also intriguing to me because it is set in an era when Hollywood had just come of its technological cliff (1958). It was made in black and white and uses many of today's current trends in film making --colorization, super-imposition, etc. Also, it is set on a fictional island. This is a very, very strange movie to watch --with a little twist at the film's end. Strange, this movie is as fascinating and intriguing as Piranha...I think. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a fantastic movie - but I must say that I was deceived by its high rating - I read reviews saying it should have a star or something, as the movie doesn't have any stars in it and a well acted, well directed, well put together movie is not needed to make it enjoyable. Don't get me wrong - I love movies which are interesting or which show great lengths and passion, for your character, plot or truth. However, this is a movie about a very, very beautiful, and charismatic woman, who loves each other, has so much compassion and love for those, underdog, little man. This is a touching and beautiful movie, with a very good cast who all give performances which make you laugh, cry and smile, at the same time. But the movie lacks in these three attributes, and thus, does not satisfy. However, if you've seen the movie, do yourself a favor and rent it for yourself, this is one of my favorite movies, as well as Lestat, which is also about a little man. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Oh, I saw this movie, and didn't even knew that a movie could ever be this bad! Whoo, I know that you will not like this movie, whoo, I know that you will think that you will have to see a \"horror\" movie! Don't miss out on an all-time-worst movie experience, even for fun, for laughs, for gore-the movie you can not believe! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_RE\n",

      " this movie, and even when I first started seeing it on HBO a few months ago, I thought it was a really wonderful story...not just because that's why I started watching, and not just because of the gorgeous actresses in the early scenes and the great storyline, but because you get to see how an average guy goes about achieving his aim. I'd give it a 10 out of 10 since I think it's very different from other movies... it's definitely worth your time to watch! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a little scary-- but I found it to be the best one. The killer was a lot more terrifying than the typical killer in most movies. And even though they did a great job with what they had there is no reason to believe that it couldn't be done in real life-- so it's not just a movie where they get to take over the entire movie. They actually do a little research to confirm what they have at the end: the movie shows exactly how they get into the car and how. It all makes sense.<br /><br />I've always liked the movie: it's not scary so it gets a 9-- but when I see another movie (like the ones I've seen here) I immediately start getting worried (not in the fact of who's dead or what is planned out, but what may happen) <br /><br />I give this movie a 9-- and if you're thinking that it may not be scary, you're right. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ One would think that a movie that boasts character actors like Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt could be good. But it isn't. The characters come off as dull, one dimensional characters that have zero depth, which I found odd. I haven't seen any movie with characters that are this boring. For example, in the scene where these main characters were discussing their boredom with the phone book being so boring, they basically said nothing about this. It seems as though the movie was shot over a period of weeks with little to distinguish what it was about. There is also nothing in this movie that people could care about. The only people I could care about is who this movie was aimed at. It's not real life-- there is no character drama at all, not much action, and only two characters that spark off each other in an interesting way. They are two kids (one 15, the other who is still grieving her sister's death) and they are about to get married! There are other characters that are about to die. It's a boring movie. It's also a bad movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a horrible attempt at comedy. The first half is very interesting and funny with lots of in-jokes, but the second half is horrible in its writing and screenplay. It's an extremely poor adaptation of Steven Sodebergh's classic play.<br /><br />This movie is so bad it actually makes me laugh and feels in an empty movie like me. The cast tries to make the movie successful by trying to be funny but not succeeding. I have no problem with bad movies in themselves but it takes a major effort to tell a joke correctly. My advice: don't watch. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ After watching this show i began noticing a pattern emerging in the behavior of the cast, the character acting and the plot. They act like they really have no clue what an A. has got to do with drugs to where I am beginning to think cocaine is a more evil enemy than the people on it. The entire show I.Q. does not do this show any favours. The dialogue is forced and the plot is nonsensical. I.Q. is at this show to make you feel better, not make you feel ill, have a look at the other reviews for more detail. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The film itself is a well-made and fascinating documentary, which also deals with the drug issue in that particular context: the story of Pablo Escobar. Pablo heads out to his father's house for security services, and once there he is involved with a group of people which he knows must be offshoots of The Family in the 1970s, because they make drugs and sell them on the Caribbean island of Ibiza, in what the film calls an \"entertainment zone.\"<br /><br />He makes good use of some of the many creative angles and techniques presented in this film, and the film also provides much insight into Pablo's life, including his connection with his father - who, at one time, played the role of a narcist himself - in one of his own ways.<br /><br />The film offers a lot of excellent characterisations that are all a part of Escobar's life, and the fact is that the film doesn't sugar-coat\n",

      " editing, the fact that he never bothered to learn how to play the instrument seemed a foreshadowing of his demise. As the film goes beyond his playing, we are subjected to a series of music montages. From \"I Know All\" on (no pun intended) I did get a little confused and excited. I thought it was going to be an opera. The guy in black speaks dub over the credits, and I've gotta tell to you, Mr. Gorman did this on purpose. It was like an opera in this that I was not entirely sure what type of music I was supposed to be listening to. Not that I'm a total novice by any means, but the man (of the hour) seemed to kind of play a musical instrument with a stick. I'm also not a film student so I wasn't really sure how exactly the music selection process worked, but I did pick up a lot of songs from her collection.<br /><br />I'm a young kid who's into all the bands and movie and TV shows, and this movie was making me think a little more about all the different types of music. Some of it made sense, but a lot of it was just a little too speculative and I still think some of it was missing. I think there was definitely some hidden message there. <br /><br />Overall I gave this one 9/10, though the last couple of minutes were a little bit of a drag. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This should be rated and sold separately!!! I bought this with the intention of watching it in the theatre with friends as I had to do my best to pass it around to my girlfriends to sit in and look at as I would like. Well, the funny thing is, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. It's a bit of both, and it's a movie which has taken a funny idea and taken it and run with it. I was surprised to see the likes of Dabney Coleman, Peter Dinklage and James Belushi, who I would not normally pay to be in movies, turn into the nicest and most lovely characters. There is even a side plot which involves a retired police detective (Peter Dinklage) trying to take over his daughter's school... When I finished watching this I did not expect much, and I wasn't. The acting is good, the characters likable and the whole idea of the school being called upon to face the evils of the world is interesting and controversial, so I can recommend this one. \"The School\" has a decent and entertaining story, and is well paced. What I don't like is that it doesn't allow you to see things from different points of view. It's like \"Duck Soup\" where you never know what the other guy is going on to in the next scene. I didn't think Peter Dinklage or James Belushi were really believable as the characters, since there were the occasional odd moments when I couldn't really figure why they were doing what they were doing. I also didn't like the other actors that played part-so-far-in-the-actor-casting. The only actor that really stood out in the cast was Peter Dinklage, but I do think that he was the weakest link since both actors have been in a lot of really bad movies. I really like \"Escape from New York\" for similar reasons. I really liked the film though, even if it was an \"ok\" movie for me.<br /><br />This is definitely a good family-friendly movie. However some parts of the story (and it has a lot in it) could have easily crossed the line into being a little more serious. Enjoy it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This was a very poorly made movie with terrible actors. The only saving graces were a few very attractive female cast members. The film is about a school of women who are told that if they will go through with their plans of having a threesome with another woman that they will have an 'OK' life. The very reality of these girls is made very difficult at times and the only way they seem to get around it is via going to secluded places and being totally self absorbed. At times the plot is very confusing and it is best not to watch the movie. In most cases these minor aspects can be forgiven though. Most people will seem confused because of the nature of the film and will avoid it. See it for the acting alone and forget the rest. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It's hard to explain this movie - might be the most pointless movie that I've ever seen. It has nothing. Nothing.

      "ne (Dennis Hopper) is a hard driving, hard to kill detective, he's been on the force for over 20 years, and is now being pursued by two of his former superiors. (I'd have to say those guys were even worse than his former colleagues, but I wont give that away) Their upstart, with the addition of a young, talented but cocky young rapper, Tanisha (De Niro), and an established, grizzled veteran of the old guard, is off to a great start, as Tanisha goes looking for some big shot, and gets more than he bargained for. That's when things go seriously wrong. You gotta love that old, slow motel motel scene. You feel sorry for the poor old men and women that have to put up with this lowlife, don't get out. <br /><br />It's really a shame the DVD isn't titled \"The Big Trail\" in North America, for neither North America, nor Japan are on the North American version. Well, it is. It is also unfortunate, the two European versions (which are North America, and Japan) are so different, that I don't know where the similarities really are - but they just feel like a different release of that one movie. I had trouble with the subtitles, and it's probably just the fact that the German and French versions feel quite distant from North America. <br /><br />All in all this is a superb movie that can be appreciated by all ages. I only wish the DVD version was in English rather than the \"deutsch\" version, but if that's alright with ya.. then I recommend this movie. Just don't miss it if it's not listed here.<br /><br />8/10 - The new, better DVD version of this movie. Don't miss it, watch it the first with the original language subtitling. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The two great, classic directors - Douglas Sirk (Tintin, My Neighbor Ted) and, later, Robert Rodriguez, produced this film which is easily the best documentary I know that also produced the best film festival nomination (the last one) at the Venice Film Festival. <br /><br />The film tells the story about Tintin, a creator (of the most of the comics, such as Iron Maiden, Judi Flockhart, etc.) and her heroine to be, what is the essence of a hero, and who is Tintin's greatest enemy. I am not a big fan of the American cartoon, but I think that a film can help people to be more open-minded about the world in which they live. For example a film like this not only helps people to have a good taste in what they watch, but it can also help people to learn about the world through the eyes of someone so different. I am convinced that as films proceed, they will make it easier for people to come to a new appreciation for the American cartoon with more intelligent film makers. (By the way an American cartoon is really very nice, very funny, clever, original, clever but, all that)<br /><br />I hope people will have many chances to see this film, and they will choose to add it to wherever they go, and to watch it.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw the film about two guys making a video game (which I bought off a video game shop) and decided that I should give it a watch. I didn't expect it to be a lot better than what I did. However, I did expect a bit of substance and I was still disappointed. The movie fails on all accounts: it's too talky, with too much exposition needed at times and not enough action at other times. I kept waiting for something to happen, however, and had hopes there were some kind of grand finale, but they didn't. If it's the quality of acting I like, then it's only a good thing. In fact, for the first half hour or so, they were the best parts of the movie, but it went downhill rapidly after that. For those who have seen the plot before, the movie works great in the beginning, but after the credits roll the story just gets messy and muddles. When I saw the movie again, it was on my second TV, but still looked interesting, so I decided to give it another shot. As I said, the acting is excellent, so I guess the rest is not a surprise. If you've seen the plot, and you enjoyed it, I don't know that the acting is a reason not to recommend it. I don't think I'd be able to enjoy the story or the film if it was any good without the acting. All in all, I've seen better, but for the price I paid, I still found it to be a little strange and contrived\n",

      " hidden on the set where this film was being made. The film's acting is so horrible it can only be forgiven with tears in your eyes. The script is so bad the actors become unrecognisable (see the scene in the store). And the soundtrack? There are so many parts where this gets on video that people are saying to each other in an unhappy attempt at 'Bubba Ho-taye' (which is more difficult to pronounce than 'Bubba Ho-taye').<br /><br />The film is shot in a very similar fashion to the awful 'High School', and has the added charm of a 'Gothic' style. However, the plot is totally unrealistic, and the action is totally out of place. The acting is so bad, I am only quoting the top five worst. And despite its age rating, 'Superstar' never gets old (an achievement for which I thank the F.C.C.) _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is not an epic, but it is a good story. <br /><br />The scenes are very romantic. <br /><br />The actors are very good. <br /><br />The story is beautiful and romantic.<br /><br />The characters have an innocent romance.<br /><br />The actors are very beautiful.<br /><br />The director is beautiful.<br /><br />A very good movie.<br /><br />I don't recommend renting or watching this movie. I recommend watching the television show.<br /><br />In all I want to give my gratitude to the actors and the actors who did the best to bring a romantic story to life. <br /><br />I think the entire public can watch the movie and enjoy, not a lot of sex scenes, and an excellent story. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ First of all, I thought it was a good idea to interview two people from different countries, and first of all, it is not the truth. America is not exactly a paradise, but it isn't completely devoid of bad guys, and not all US movies are created to show US as the hell you are. It is also not the \"warship of the century.\" The second point I would like to stress is that I'm really only using as an example, how would anyone else describe an American movie, the same way I'm describing the Titanic, because America was in the \"Best for the People\" camp until the end of 2001. What was happening in the last 50 years has changed everything, and you just can't talk about a \"wave of terror\" about the coming nuclear war, not in 2000. (I mean, really, nobody can talk about it as the \"wave\" of the \"fourth wall like Mr. DeNiro and Mr. Pitt did). The \"wave of terror\" in 2000 was about the possibility of a terrorist attack on America, which would begin an arms race, and the destruction or elimination from the inside. The current war on the human side of the train, however, is a little bit different. This movie is a piece of fiction, and because of that - or maybe because of that, because it was a movie released in the \"wave of terror of 2001\"- and because everyone is so stupid that they don't realize this, we'll have a war to suffer, and win, if we realize the seriousness of the problems we have. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It is very good but is a movie that you have to admit is wrong to go see if you like Tintin's work - the movie is well done, but it is not the only movie he has directed. He did other one here, the story was better. But at least the movie is different. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I went on viewing this flick on the DVD yesterday and got all the way through it, something I've done in the past with other Joe D'amato flicks. Well this one is by far the worst I've seen. But the problem has more to do with some inconsistencies in the story than with the movie itself.<br /><br />Joe D'amato did an awful job directing this one. He seems to have gotten rid of the talent he honed at the beginning of his career directing horror films, and replaced with a bunch of actors and an over script; it's not much of a job. This one has a great storyline and nice atmosphere but it just is totally ill written, not believable and the story never really comes together.<br /><br />The acting is quite bad but maybe it's the story itself that makes it a good job. The \"master\" of the film is clearly the female lead, and this is really the only reason you'll see her in it. This is a movie about a man seducing a woman,\n",

      " who is being portrayed as a psychopath who will destroy everything he once loved.<br /><br />There isn't one single bit of true entertainment in this movie, and the fact it is a made-for-TV movie, doesn't add up. Even the good things it has going for it are so tenuous that you know one is definitely treading water before the end. The whole plot is one big cliche, and when it gets wrapped up into a big family (or whatever), it just makes the whole thing feel like a big joke. There are no real new elements to this story or anything new to be learned about. It's basically just a sequel to an older film, and since this film has nothing new to do with the original except for possibly renaming it, it comes across as being completely lifeless regardless of it's quality. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ As the year 2006 begins, the new President Rodrigo Duterte has begun his dangerous war on drugs. While many drugs are illegal, the use of the drug are up. That means that there are now over 800,000 street killings in the Philippines alone. People are being killed with bags of drugs in Manila Bay alone. While drug users are often seen as easy targets, they are being snorted at gunpoint. People are dying from the heroin epidemic sweeping across Asia and the US. There is a new police chief in the Philippines named Manuel Roxas. The murder squad named Reyes has been formed to eliminate Roxas. Reyes is carrying a large stash of illegal drugs in his patrol car. How will these men get the drugs away?<br /><br />\"Drugs of a Kind\" is a very funny comedy. All the characters are funny and interesting, including the new drug czar who is carrying a huge stash of illegal drugs on his car. One wonders how this film will end. It seems that no drug offender is going to go quietly. The ending is not something I was expecting.<br /><br />7 out of 10 - There is some good humor, but few violent scenes. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I'm not saying that this movie is the worst movie I've ever seen but it was nowhere near as horrible as I'm making it out to be. This movie has the odd bad scene but if that, then I can live with it. I thought the movie was alright. It was fun to watch, some of the stunts weren't as good as they could have been but they were still fun to watch. I would see this movie again as I would watch anything nowadays. If the scene didn't suck so bad then I'd probably watch it again and again. It's an older movie so I guess that doesn't affect it's appeal, so long as you like your action. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I first saw this when it was released. It was a really interesting story, and the performances by the two stars (Hutton and Hutton) weren't half-bad. But now that it's become a complete mess, I can't really recommend it. Sure, the plot might be a little daft, and the dialogue is a little silly and corny, but that ain't a big deal. As for the story, it's so daft that it has no story--just some dumb kid and his dumb dog. The rest is simply pure unadulterated drivel. This really sucks. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ As a teenager I was a big fan of this film, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, those hopes and expectations were way too high. First, the music was a terrible ripoff of Led Zeppelin I wasn't even aware of until this film was released. The film doesn't sound even half-way decent, just generic rock and a terrible lead singer. The visuals of the film were great, the casting looked like it could have been done in an interesting 80's style, the acting seemed like it could have been very authentic (which isn't helped by the dubbing), and the storyline was so predictable it could only have been used in a Lifetime special.<br /><br />I don't think this was even made by the same people that made Grosse Point blank and the sequel to it. I don't think that any of the original cast or crew were even involved in this film. It shows that there are so many talented people working on a project that are just plain incompetent. To call this a sequel to Grosse Point blank is like claiming the Mississippi river has the same history as the Buffalo river. The only thing the sequel does have going for it is the fact that it doesn't even have the same actors, so most of the film is wasted on wasted characters that seem like bad porn. There is absolutely no actual action in this film, just a collection of poorly drawn shots of people doing nothing much and nothing interesting (and nothing interesting\n",

      ", you must know that if you are serious about this stuff, you wouldn't even bother, and if you do, you know what my friends and I thought of it as--well, my buddies and I were correct! As a very serious person, I must say, this stuff was extremely interesting(it also took me to a very painful level), but because it is SO funny, and the scene where the dogs look at the camera, even that joke failed to make me look anywhere else but dumbfounded! The acting was great, and the music was amazing - my jaw literally fell off after the \"happy\" montage. If you like this sort of stuff, I don't think you want to miss it. It's very funny, and you really do end up feeling good about your life once you watch it! Highly recommended, and don't forget to watch it if you liked \"Paid\", which is another one of those films I really enjoyed. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Okay, there are some nice \"special effects\" used in this flick, but there was absolutely no reason to make this a horror film. What the hell is up with that? Did they really think that zombies would be so goddamn scary.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - it may be a cool flick if the characters could be infected by this deadly virus and survive. If they do, it's a pretty cool outcome, very well worth watching. It is however a pretty predictable and weak movie. <br /><br />I honestly would much rather hold my nose than look at this one again. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The original movie is a love story about the search for a soul, and a woman who finds out there's a person in there, and then, after all these years, she hasn't met that person...<br /><br />The movie was a hit in its day, and I was sooo excited for the follow-up with Laurence Fishburne in the role of that person. It was based off a play I had written for the stage some years previously... I had this wonderful passion for stage plays, and I was hoping this would prove to be a great one.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it soon grew into a very formulaic movie. Very predictable plot, with a lot of very flat line performances. And I just couldn't get into this guy at all! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I was hoping this had going to be just as funny as the original, but sadly it wasn't. As a stand on its own, it is a comedic gem. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of Jeff at all.<br /><br />For those who don't know who jean hugues ferrel, and for those who have not had the chance to see it, here's the short version - he's the main character, sort of like a cross between christopher walken and marmite. jean goes to visit his old school, and finds a group of his former classmates are now gone. A lot of the time its funny as heck, and the rest of the time its just like any other sitcom, which is sad, because sarky christopher walken has such a great presence in this.<br /><br />this was an attempt to cash in on the popularity of royalscrab, a comedy series at the time, and the plots and humor in royalscrab was much better. It could of been a lot funnier, because royalscrab is actually funny. royalscrab is a lot like how it has its laughs, it's just that royalscrab is formulaic and not funny in a genuine way, so by comparison, royalscrab feels a lot like a kid's sitcom, which is why this feels like filler between other sitcoms. You have your sitcom, and you throw in this extra special sauce to make it a sitcom, and what do you get? A lot of really terrible acting, and unrealistic dialog.<br /><br />this has no point, because the jokes go all over the place. There's not a strong point to this. The jokes just get really old, and you get the feeling that maybe the joke was kind of lost on the first time you watched. The jokes seem kind of irrelevant, and it becomes really obvious who's doing the pulling in the sitcom. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It's really fun to watch this with friends. I can barely recall most of the events, except what apparently was going on on the screen. Also, there are a lot of gags that will make you snicker. The actors are very good, and the plot is funny. I wouldn't have thought I could find something so fun to watch on a Saturday night. I don't think it gets any better than this. _SENTIMENTS\n",

      "REENTDING!!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ What are the worst things I could say about this movie? Obviously they decided to use a lot of hand held cameras to get the closeups, maybe they should have re-tooled the crew back at the factory. The director should have a long vacation. The most surprising thing is that there's a sequel to this pile of garbage that's not listed in the IMDb. I will be surprised if this won't be as boring as the first one. The director could have done a better job. The actors are all repeat offenders, so if you keep watching you will be repeating yourself. The songs they chose for the background are not memorable at all. The characters that are in this sequel are as bland as the background music. If you're going to go see this movie, get the original. That movie has plot and you care about the characters. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ When i was told that this movie would be released, i went to see it with some friends, and we walked out almost as confused as i was (i have no idea how i managed to get to the theater because i was so freaked out by the ending).<br /><br />i would be lying if I said that the ending did not make my head hurt, because i think at the end everyone really did make the right choice. The one thing that is not to like about this movie is the part where the guy goes to jail (i think maybe he was supposed to). but the other part was just bizarre. Also, the characters that got killed (the ending aside): Nick, and Darlene (the guy who freaked out lisa and freaked out the baby that they were trying to get).<br /><br />i would like to see a sequel i can all of my friends which everyone voted good .. though i would have to say, it was the first person who walked out that i hated. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie has some nice camera-work and what you have here is a romance which, however romantic, seems more suited to a highliting montage than to the dialogue...and the romance is dull. And you have a leading man whom I just could not see in anything. It seems that the producer took the idea from a novel called \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" (1939) by Charles Dickens and adapted it to cinema. It is certainly one of the best adaptations by Sirk. You have to hand it to the producer, he did not have the guts to take the story which was flat to the wire. And he played so conservative a philandering millionaire very straight-backed he was never more romantic than his love interest...not that he wanted to be romantic. But he was not the only one. Mark Borchardt adds a bit of sweetness, but he was too straight-forward to be attractive so he went and got his lover, even he went and got his lover in spite of him. It is very obvious that it was going to be a big disappointment if this kind of story ever came over, so Sirk decided to turn out the movie with this rather good song and dance routine and put a couple of good songs and dances into it. And, as if that do not throw you off this movie, the last sequence turns on the word \"vagina\" which I do hope is just a little too late. But all that, this film is bad even on terms of the worst possible quality picture that you can have. There are many better things to do than be exposed to what was going on in Germany. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I'd like to see another film made by the writer/director team of Robert Altman and Danny Kahn (from his more recent efforts, \"The Wrestler\", \"Midnight Run\", and \"Dressed to Kill\") about a Vietnam vet returning from the war. The premise is decent enough: we follow a young vet through post-traumatic stress, and how he copes with the past. But the lack of consistency in some characters motivations, especially the \"big stick\" or \"big mouth\" mentality he brought to fighting, seems to me to be too glaring to overcome. Also, the \"big-brother\" role played by the older brother, is completely unbelievable...and completely unrealistic to me. The scenes where he admits to be stuck in this terrible mess, really drag on (and they just get worse and worse). I really would like to see a real, standalone movie where the hero isn't the victim of a ridiculous and ineffectual situation (the aforementioned wrestler's situation, the \"kidnapper\", and his subsequent trip to the parking jail are just a few of the characters that seem like just another example of poor acting). After watching \"The Wrestler\", I've noticed that Altman and Kahn have some genuine\n",

      " a great work of art.<br /><br />A great and fascinating film that has given some great and unique people a name for a movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie starts out as a great movie that is pretty funny in its own way, that is until it starts getting to the point. It plays like when a student loan repayment movie will probably not be seen as such! However, it is well done, the acting is fine and the acting is excellent! My friends found it highly humorous despite most comedies that are either in the \"fun\" range or just a straight to video type of movie. If this movie is on cable, watch it! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I'm not sure if this is a spoof, but it's certainly not a subtle spoof. At times, they seem to be taking the comedy too seriously.<br /><br />The movie's cast is not bad, but when it's paired with such brilliant supporting actors, such as the mother and a young nanny, you realize just how unrecognizable they could really be.<br /><br />The movie gets a bad rap because of the \"tragic plot\", but if you look for the humor in movies like \"Wagner's Island\" and \"Night of the Comet\", those tragic plots were not so silly, either. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I rented this movie because I wanted to see a movie with a bunch of actors who I know was already in (and did well) and also wanted to see Julia Stiles. I had no idea this movie was supposed to be funny (although I thought I would get a good laugh out of it) but I was totally stunned... and I mean totally shocked... this movie totally deserves a 10 out of 10. My advice to anyone who loves movie memorabilia: BUY THIS MOVIE! You will be glad you did! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I can't believe I've reviewed such a bad movie! This is just pathetic! When I saw this movie first, it was one of the only redeeming things that I've found about it. The acting, script, and directing are all above average. However, the writing is just horrible. The movie was so far below the quality of a good comic book story that I ended up laughing until my insides hurt... like most things, bad acting, bad writing, bad everything. I think this movie was created by the talented Michael Eisner, but this movie is the product of an absolutely brilliant man, Jonathan Winberman. He is a true talent, who should have a much better career on his resume. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a movie that I thought I was going to hate! A group of high school kids in a locker room somehow gets access to all kinds of old gags by having sex in them! One of the teenage girls has her head cut off by a dude with the stick and two of the seniors get their butts kicked when they get too close to the girl who gets to run her vagina out so they can be even more exposed. The baddest girl had them sign a contract saying that if any one of the young 'dudes' fell in a pool or when they got their ass kicked by another one they would be 'substantially responsible' for their own suicide. The ending makes you want to kill yourself, don't watch it, don't buy it, don't own it!! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The movie was very good.<br /><br />The story was interesting, there were multiple plot lines throughout the movie. The dialog in the beginning of the movie was somewhat corny I will say that the same can be said of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The cast was good especially the blonde that played the lead girl. I will say that the movie ends a bit too soon though. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I couldn't have been any more cynical about this film if I had seen it first. Having seen the movie before I must say the casting of some of the leading men made me believe the film was going to be a predictable, dull, low budget affair. It was. What a great cast and plot! The premise sounded interesting. A group of friends wanting to take over their school's sports administration and have the new headmaster run the sports team. Oh yes that's where we meet our dear friend. The story is predictable but the twists, the surprises and the tension at the end were wonderful. I must recommend this film to anyone who likes thriller movies. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ First: The movie is boring. The storyline could have been the inspiration for an action/adventure movie, but the screenplay is more predictable than the classic\n",

      " as its an \"old fashioned movie\" to a \"new generation\" and has the charm of a \"young animal made to look like an old fashioned animal\" and \"cute little creatures, cute girls and great music\". If the sound effects are anything to go by, they are very high in quality. The animation is more than good enough, with clear and accurate backgrounds showing how a great deal of effort went into this. The music is mostly nice and fits some of the animals well. The voice work isn't great, and the main characters here are over the top and annoying rather than sympathetic. The \"villain\" is just a very bad actor, who steals the show and is annoying to watch. It wasn't a great movie in terms of the plot, but it had its moments.<br /><br />The ending is very good and a great deal better than the rest of the movie. In fact, all the other elements in this movie do an excellent job. This movie was an inspiration for Pixar and will have people comparing it to other movies as we get this very unusual type of animated movie as well as being a precursor to the Pixar hype. I have always enjoyed the concept of animals taking over the world and being more intelligent than humans. A lot of Pixar movies have the big problem of the animals stealing the show and it is hard to believe that they could have a \"less intelligent\" main characters. This story is about animals taking over the world and destroying it with their best in the way of showing that they are all grown up a little and ready for the next charge of violence. The result is a very good ending for the movie. Overall, a fine movie, and I wish I could find a great movie that will always appeal to me. This is certainly not just a \"cheap\" movie. You need money to enjoy this one. Go watch this movie. This movie is a gem. See it. It is very very expensive. It is very hard to find. This is an incredible film. And I am so amazed by it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a very interesting idea that has totally failed. To start the film makes you think that the 'evil' scientist has some sort of antidote to bring back the dead. But when his beautiful laboratory starts sucking the life out of various corpses of the scientists the dead begin to get real and killing them from within. So the movie starts to become an overlong overbelly comedy with many scenes failing (like when the scientist starts injecting the dead with ether to bring them back to life), it also becomes a comedy but it doesn't work at all. The bad guy is pretty well played (especially when he wears the green puffer), but he's completely wasted and you are constantly wondering what he is thinking. The only good performance is the actress who portrays the girlfriend of the girl who has to live with the boyfriend while the scientist does his best to kill him. Overall, it is an overlong comedy with a serious and completely pointless sub plot that is completely illogical. Overall, avoid this movie unless your on a quest for the worst comedy ever made. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"Kitten Natividad\" is a very funny and touching documentary released recently by HBO's Open Road Films. The main objective of this film is highlighting the relationship between breast augmentation and breast augmentation: what does it mean, why does it happen, and can it be stopped? Also, the subject is gender neutral...there is nothing negative or sensational about this picture. The filmmakers have divided the people into different groups as well as shown their backgrounds. The most important part of the film is clearly the relationship between the breast augment surgeon (one of the most popular and famous of all this kind), the young girl, and the young mother, all named Jan and Janie. This is the first time I've witnessed anyone so many people so act so positively and honestly. The second part highlights the relationship between the two people. I know you all know, the protagonist Janie, who is very passionate about her interest in augmentation, and her mother Janie, who is focused on breast augmentation technology because, she says she is willing to kill someone for it. Then finally we see Janet, who has just lost her husband and son, and feels real shame for losing her husband and son's trust and then being ashamed to have done it. I really can't tell you how this story was filmed, but it must have been very close.<br /><br />\"Kitten Natividad\" is a great documentary because it has a kind of honesty which really impressed me. The film is well-edited, I recommend that you see it before it. Also, in this documentary you can find a very, very, very creative and intriguing. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am a young college student studying Arabic, and here is a movie that I am compelled to\n",

      " to discuss how we have become a country whose institutions are so full of hypocrisy. We can't agree on a format, but the tone of our discussion is the choice of the winner. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ You know Stephen King is always making movies, right? So yeah, I rented this movie. And since we're not really interested in horror (I'm really afraid we won't be subscribing until the 'Fury of the Wolfman') we shouldn't watch it. But let's be honest, you know even I'm partial to awful horror movies. It was nothing spectacular, but nothing bad, either. It would be impossible to make a movie like this, one of the best horror films ever made, and that it's not even the best. But still, I loved it.<br /><br />The plot is simple. In the year 2002, a young family moves to the mountains of Northern Illinois, a small region of rural America covered in corn, soybeans, and other essentials. The young boy, Adam, dreams of being a farmer and has taken a break from school and his soccer team. From the start of the movie, his parents are awful to each other and he, the younger boy, is so eager to move to Nebraska that he wants to have Adam and his family there, too. The father is a farmer and the son Adam is trying to grow corn on his own. But in the end, the older boy gets in his car when he stops in the middle of the road somewhere and is picked up by his father who's just returned to the family from New York. The two of them then spend a night together with Adam.<br /><br />Now, the movie is not as good as I expected it would be, but it's good nonetheless. Most of its atmosphere is the perfect preparation for C.S. Lewis's Twilight Zone episode in a good way that keeps you completely on edge. The characters are solid throughout, but in the last analysis, it will probably put you on the edge of your seat. The only flaw in the movie is that the ending is somewhat silly, especially when the killer turns out to be none other than the mother (Eugene Pallette, a very good actor in smaller roles), and the final words of Adam (Eddie Ross of \"Mary's World\"). In the end, I was happy that all the events were resolved, but the story itself is somewhat lame. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film is a typical comedy about a guy who has a stupidly violent hobby. At the end of the movie, he pays a price but does not \"pay\" for it. He just gets arrested and served with the county jail time for playing with loaded swing swords. He also must live in squalor for a while after that. The film takes off somewhere midway through the first half. The rest is pretty much flat, and the only thing of interest is trying to find a couple of decent performances from this cast.<br /><br />However, after a while, you get sick of the constant and repetitive sight of \"Tom Hanks\". \"Hey, I knew him from 'All About Eve'.\" \"I have no doubt that you have a couple of brain cells, but when this gets too intense, you're gonna kick yourself!\"<br /><br />The movie is also quite slow in a major part. This is just to demonstrate a few ways of killing a movie. Don't be fooled by the ridiculousness of \"I can live without you playing Magic Mike!\". It's pretty close to the heart.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is one of my favorite of the series. And while it doesn't seem to bear any similarities to either the original story or the other three films, it provides a refreshing change of pace. The characters are all likable from a start, making the film feel rather realistic. It's not usually this snappy and funny to see a love story where everybody seems to be happy and all of whom it comes naturally.<br /><br />All of these elements - a fast social story, no mean feat of cinema, comedy and romance combined into one - make the movie one of the best of its kind. The characters are very well developed and offer real people, interesting characters - if not all-too-real, intriguing characters. All in all, a rather good feel-good movie that's worth the price of a rental. If you're at all a fan of the Dukes of Hazzard, you would be better advised to see it if only for this reason.<br /><br />7/10 - Just shy of the mark _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I watched this film last month and will be watching it up to the end (maybe the next week or so).

      " and to be on \"The Tonight Show,\" he was already famous enough to be able to act in movies like \"Dawn Patrol\" and \"Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" and he just got stupider and stupider with each one. And his voice changed with each movie he made, in order to make him sound like a different person. This show wasn't for the faint of heart or the mindless. To give an example of how bad this show is, here is a list of the problems: 1) He's constantly making out with girls in the shower.<br /><br />2) The show starts with him telling someone they can be next to him at a party without him even being gone.<br /><br />3) A girl is picked at random and there's nothing that is supposed to tie her to him. She's just there.<br /><br />4) All of the sudden, his home is suddenly turned as a bank.<br /><br />5) He has a crush on one of the girls. He tells her he wants to spend time with her but then they sit in the same movie room talking. And he shows her what is happening to the previous 3 roommates.<br /><br />6) He has no clue what to handle with the other roommates when it comes to her.<br /><br />7) The show starts with him doing things no one wouldn't do in real life to get his own apartment back. The girls who get picked just got picked because of the same characteristics.<br /><br />8) If you like cheesy movies that feature lots of random characters and plot holes, you won't like this show at all. The movie plot was pretty much the same as \"The Tonight Show.\" One could make a few similarities, like three female characters, going through the same situations just with different names, but those similarities are quite thin compared to the original plot of \"The Tonight Show\" even without the original characters. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I am a very big mystery movie fan. Although there are good productions of bad movies, there are a lot of very good production, but don't try to compare it with anything of the same quality as you saw on the \"Scrubs\" and it's own. Some small details: the character of the girl who keeps having sex with Noah is very well acted.<br /><br />The script is great! <br /><br />The story is so funny that it will have the viewer yelling every few scenes....great stuff!<br /><br />The show is very realistic, and I loved it. I like these types of comedy, its very unique. Its hard to make it, though, because some episodes are quite serious. That said, its worth a watch, but don't expect anything of \"Ok lets go do something like that...\"<br /><br />My rating: *** (out of 10) _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A group of young women, one of whom is married (or rather, living from death) take to the beach in the Spanish enclave of Melilla to spend a couple of days in nature after a small Spanish ship gets torpedoed and one of the women's relatives is found dead. However, as the date of the film approaches, the women change from their normally seductive colors of green and yellow into something completely different, leading our attention to the story much sooner.<br /><br />As the women walk towards the island, a group of men run up to them singing violent car-chases and shots of blood splattering walls. It really is the women's prison and we never find out how they escaped but, from here the action gets less involving as the women disappear into nothing but the presence of the men. At first we are expected to find that all women, especially if they live in death, are greedy slobs who eat men to satisfy their hunger for blood. But one of the women is kind-hearted and willing to give up her life for her lover, who she would otherwise never have met. To make matters worse, half of this prison is a sort of virtual prison as all of the women seem to take the same jobs - housekeeping, cooking - only they somehow seem to get ahead. However, in an effort to escape, the women are lured back to the island by an old woman who offers them a special escape, one of them doing the kitchen work, another using a wheel chair. The result is a violent confrontation - in both cases with each other and with the elderly woman, but it ultimately ends on a high note as the men do not make it out alive and the women are offered a gallows. Now we have a chance to find out what has happened but its not very good. There were a lot of characters in the middle of the women prison and I didn't know who to name so, it was probably the four main characters -\n",

      "'s the movie's real strength (again). That is in large part due to the very entertaining soundtrack that features classical music by Gustav Mahler and the German-flavored \"Germane ins Untergang\", which is performed by Wolfgang von Siemerling and backed by the incomparable Beethoven. The music also is extremely well-chosen. The best songs are \"Tout Trois Petite Ennocet\" and \"Tout Trois Petite Elle\", one of the best songs of the 1940s, and \"Le Cercle Rouge\", also an obvious highlight that one can hear in almost every scene. Also in the film are some very funny gags. The first one is \"How to make a fire\"-scene where two gang members sing \"I'm just doing this for a living\" in a restaurant. And of course, the most forgettable example is the famous scene when two gangs are fighting over Beethoven: Beethoven has his musical instrument stuck to his forehead and starts banging on it until it blurs and becomes unrecognizable. That was just hilarious! Of course, the true gem of the movies is the dialogue. It's incredibly witty. The scenes with the geeks fighting over Beethoven's missing instrument are a hoot. This is a must-see! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a great picture with an excellent script, acting from all the actors, great direction and beautiful pictures. It takes me under the skin. It's not a romantic film about love, it's a film about life, about life experiences. I love everything that this film has to offer. If you love life or just want to watch excellent films that take you where you haven't expected, this is a film for you. If you love romantic comedies (I know I do), this is for you. Don't expect great plot points, twists, you'll take what its getting, but you'll never be bored with it. The film is wonderfully made, beautifully shot, beautifully acted, beautifully acted by some top players. The fact that you realize the human emotion is in all of us doesn't make the film all that much different from real life. If you don't like the idea of living a really weird and fantastic life, then this film isn't for you. But if you'd like to see the true story of a woman, who was determined to prove that all the men were wrong about her life, then watch this film and learn from it, what can you learn. If you want to see a true story, then this film's the movie for you.<br /><br />10 out of 10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I remember, long ago, seeing an advert for this film in The Times newspaper back in the early 1980's. What I did was to download it from the nordic film website, and watching it I got an idea of what this film had to offer. How right it was!<br /><br />At the time I was a child of the eighties - this film reminded me of films such as The Golden Child, The Thin Blue Line or The Spy Who Loved Me. As I grew older I realised, this film wasn't really that good.<br /><br />So why did I watch it then? The simple answer is that, on the surface it's a good story, about a father who brings his teenage daughter to his parent's house on holiday for a 'family reunion'. The film is set around the very end of 1980, after the war.<br /><br />The fact that the film is set in a time before The First World War and before The Falklands War also adds an authenticity to the film that is rather lost in contemporary films.<br /><br />Not enough to give it serious points because the script is quite uninspired, and the dialogue between real people is particularly poor.<br /><br />Still, you have to admire the talent of the movie makers here, for their work is simply superb. I've seen several films from director Ron Howard, which all seem to be directed and engineered best for the screen. For those whose tastes are drawn to more cerebral films (the kind from the likes of David Lynch, Quentin Tarantino etc.), this is an obvious good starting point for you. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I think this movie has a great director who knows what he is doing. The main actor is perfect. If you like the dark type of movies, maybe a bit less gory, this movie is for you. The camera angles have some really creepy scenes, great for horror. The music is really cool! Definitely a good watch. A good choice for a rainy night rental! Well worth seeing. Great for a couple laughs, some scares, and some scares! 8 out of 10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The one and only\n",

      " have to be in the beginning. It's a nice story for kids (or, adults if kids are too young) and for adults that want to follow the kids. It's fun with an interesting (but simple and yet very entertaining) storyline. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a great movie. There are many characters that you quickly start to love and become really attached to that person. I liked it so much I've bought the DVD as soon as it came out and I would definitely buy it again. The storyline, the cast (including the two main stars), the director and director's cut (which I didn't notice until I watched the DVD) and of course the music is perfect. I just feel so grateful and lucky to have met John and Anne. I don't want to give away the ending, either. It's truly amazing. This is a must-see and I'm very, very sorry to say that there was not an Oscar at the Oscars. I saw this movie with my best friend and it's definitely worth having a double-bill with your best friend to watch. Please make sure you see this movie. It is an excellent film with wonderful characters and an excellent story. It just feels like forever until it's a movie you can share with someone else. Thanks for everyone who has taken the time to review for me, I truly appreciate it! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It looks like, after watching this movie, somebody will probably cry at the end.<br /><br />That is why this movie gets a 1 from me.<br /><br />That being said, even that means the movie has better acting, a better story, and more original (as in \"creepy\") dialog than this \"game\" deserves.<br /><br />Oh, it might have been decent for an hour...but it is sooooo long! And, for a movie that runs almost 2 hours, you have to be doing something...harder than that!<br /><br />It was just long and pointless. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I know that there's a lot of talent represented on the screen by the cast. However, the dialog doesn't help because these are mostly sub-titles that serve as a crutch for poorly dubbed audio. The voice work was very solid, but I was never convinced why they chose to cast actors that have appeared in so many other shows, including the main characters. There are some well-known stars, however, including Jeff Fahey's \"Cigarette Burns\" (a comparison of the character with Ken Waldman's \"The Computer Wore Glasses\" from \"The Computer Wore Millions\") and Pamela Hensley (\"Honeymoon in Paris,\" \"The Nutty Professor,\" \"Love In My Life\"). And the guest stars were solid. I have to give credit where credit's due: Ken Stowers (\"Dinosaurs,\" \"Stingray Monster,\" \"Boggy Creek,\" \"Gremlins,\" \"Raptor,\" \"The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.\") as Jonathan Archer, the \"Master of Suspense\" actually gives the character a human (though I'm not sure that he believes it himself). There's no character development for him and his wife or daughter, so the dialog is hollow.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad that I sat down to see this a second time, because I just sat through another 90 minutes of bad-acted, repeated music-video-style film that doesn't work. And if it wasn't for the good cast, this would never even be made. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film was really good but one thing was missing. A good plot. What about the fact the the heroine (Taji) was half-Namer and half-Julie. The movie was about a young woman and a war veteran and they didn't have any real love. Also, the part where he finally got over the trauma of losing her. I'm just not that happy about a gay film. I wish I would've felt more emotion about his wife, and the movie was kind of sad. I can't believe the author gave his first name in writing on the plot. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ If it wasn't for the terrible (and poorly dubbed) English subtitles i had trouble following this movie. Everything seemed \"clunky\" and a bit unbelievable with the constant \"switches\" and flashes of something moving on... the whole \"is that a sign from the future?\" thing made me sick. Also, the one scene was completely unrelated to the rest of the movie: it could have easily been pulled off by any student film teacher with basic film fundamentals such as exposure, focus, light, etc. Simply a very poorly made movie.

      " for this film). The film was obviously made in order to be taken seriously, and to avoid the hype surrounding it, and the negative attention it got online after the initial release, which was kind of 'blown-away Hollywood' but still captures some 'mainstream' type of attention (and rightfully deserved). I'll admit though all the hype surrounding this film didn't help and it's a shame that the rest of the world didn't get to see this. In any case, see it and bear with it, really appreciate it (it's a really good film!), but don't take it too seriously. Not a bad flick. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"The Cure\" is a great example of how low budget science fiction can look and feel. The production values are a little high, if the cinematography is an objective assessment of its own limitations.<br /><br />The film begins by a young scientist (Michael Ironside) being approached by a government agency about helping in the battle against the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qa'ida. From the sounds of it, the agency is going to push a database on potential Muslim terrorists to be placed on the internet so that innocent people can be falsely labeled as potential terrorists. Ironside is the director and takes full advantage of his small celebrity to improve the image of Al-Qa'ida and to attract more potential recruits into the CIA cause. At this point there is a major problem of many who will oppose the cause. Al-Qa'ida are neither Muslims nor Arabs. They are a persecuted sect within the mainstream American society. Therefore, it's not a big surprise when the agency takes action against them. <br /><br />The acting spans the spectrum of acting experience, from the mediocre to the excellent. For example, a character played by Sean Connery is not Sean Connery, when the name is pronounced like with his initials.<br /><br />There are some plot holes here. What did cause the father to be so mad and dangerous, especially when his ex-wife (Joan Cusack) would be not a good person to mess with? Apart from these minor problems, the general story line seemed to be going nowhere; perhaps there wasn't a good enough reason for the characters to continue the chase. But once it was all over, I couldn't help but to wonder, where the hell did Connery and crew get the inspiration for this mess. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It seems no matter who sees an old movie first, someone else wants to replicate it, like \"Billy Bath\" by George Segal (see the segal version here). I don't mind this at all, even if it is clear to see that this one is a spoiled little brat with a spoiled childhood (however, no one will ever understand why he would want to emulate such a great man, he'll learn). \"Treat My Hands\" starts of as a comedy, but unfortunately, is nothing but a spoiled piece of spoiled, half-hearted trash that tries to be more than it is. Don't take the movie if it is 80's trash, but if it actually is 20 years behind, don't waste your time. The movie will do anyone but \"Treat My Hands\" proud!<br /><br />2 out of 10<br /><br />(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other new releases) _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I've seen lots of movies and I've read alot of books about Shakespeare, and I know many people enjoyed this movie greatly. It's true the acting was not well done at times, especially Elizabethan England, but other than that, I've never felt anyone was bad because of their religion (except Jesmyr] or cause of what they are. I also found George the implausible (sounds a lot like George Bush to me), but I've seen many poor performances by William Hurt (as you can see he is not George Bush), and I really think he could do much better. However, I strongly recommend this movie if you are prepared to laugh at a very religious person. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I would never have expected I would find this show funny. I have found this show much funnier than any comedy on television today.<br /><br />The main reason I've been watching is because in my opinion it's a show better than \"Dear John\", probably the greatest show to come on TV in years.<br /><br />It's nice to see a show that you can laugh at the same time. I have no qualms about having watched a show that is hilarious.<br /><br />The one thing I have found funny is when a character is in college and he tries to prove he's not a loser by dressing and behaving\n",

      " Sport-Masters like \"The Great Rivalry\" or \"The Great Yank\". The scenes of a city streetlaying the \"great stones\" (the film's title, by the way, is also its beginning; it is not \"Great Stone's Falls\", but from \"Lost Canyon\") are beautifully rendered, and the film even holds up very well afterwards, thanks, in large part, to excellent post-production work. This, of course, does not diminish its flaws - the film was shot on 17mm, which is, to its credit, not a problem when you have the stars you're aiming at - it's just that the film isn't very good at all, and it never reaches the levels of classic or even contemporary film that it could have been.<br /><br />It's a pity. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I am happy to report that the first season of The Simpsons was a bit wonky when compared to this first episode - but season 2 began on the brighter note of 'splash' with Homer 'awful' acting. What was Homer supposed to be doing in a real life situation? <br /><br />All this is the main reason why i switched over to The Simpsons on DVD: The series simply does not hold water. <br /><br />However there are still some funny moments. Like the 'hilarious' scene in the film factory when the girl sees the sign in the window that 'we have just two more minutes'. Or the 'mood for a change and we have an ep with Homer, Moe & Simpson in a rather poignant scene that is uplifting at some points, but the next scene is the kind that makes you laugh, not really funny.<br /><br />Simpson's acting is so far the main reason why I am tempted for the second season. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It's hard to follow this movie at first. But, as your taste for horror increases you'll find more and more that this movie is really stupid! <br /><br />First - the storyline sucks! - a few simple facts about Greece will show it. The director's attempt to make a movie completely out of a bunch of stories connected by the same thing - in the end they are, just a cheap trick, as it turned out! - will only bring a few laughs!<br /><br />Secondly - what you can't say about the characters: the \"heroes\" (well - the one really tries to be an hero) don't even manage to act to save their lives! They walk around covered in blood, just like the characters in the \"classic\" movies! Some people can't understand them (hello... \"Sauropodles\"), some of them can barely speak !<br /><br />And, above all - the director doesn't care about the story (how can you get a \"good\" movie out of a crap storyline ?!)<br /><br />I think I was expecting to see a \"Godzilla\"-like movie, but this is not even that ! If you ask me the story is quite annoying. The plot doesn't really follow the basics of comedy. Even the best you can do once in your life this movie. I guess in Greece the comedy \"is\" rated better than the horror (thank you Theatromiou)! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Another great performance by the brilliant Kenneth Branagh (see THE STANDING BY JOHNNY) and a very understated performance in that of Paul Newman (see GOOD NIGHT MARY). It's not always easy to keep \"realism\" out of your acting arsenal when the characters are in such peril, but you don't have a choice here.<br /><br />The cast includes John Glover (add a hint of the Tod Browning you see in THE KING OF THE STRAW DINOS), whom you might remember for starring in \"Mr. Deeds\" which was released the same year.<br /><br />My only quibble has always been that one of the most intriguing sequences in which we are treated to a shot of the house being built, the same sequence that plays over the \"Omish\" sequence in THE GOOD WINTER REVIEW and the climax in LADY ANNA GARLAND. The other flaw in the movie is the inclusion of the two \"Oz\" leads in this film. They were not available for a director, writer, producer, writer (or editor) just yet. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A movie that might be good for the most part, turns out to be too dumb for its own good. The last ten minutes or so, were my personal favorite parts. The only \"serious\" flick on my list that I think was this good was The Man with the Golden Arm and Man with the toothbrush\n",

      "ENTSEND_REVIEW_ One of the worst martial arts films ever made!! This has to be the WORST film I have ever seen.<br /><br />Not one character is likable, one is exciting, none of them are interesting. Just all there is of the characters that are the most likable. What can be more boring and boring then a movie with three boring, boring, annoying baddies all fighting with one man that is supposed to be bad...<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable fights in the film is the guy that is supposed to be fighting. It is completely laughable and does not even show up close to the camera which was a great idea. This film just ends the way every movie should end, with the guy kicking the other guy across the hall or in the backyard of the guy that is talking to him. Either that or we are supposed to laugh at this stupid movie in some way.<br /><br />The only highlight in the film is the fight scenes with some very cheap and poorly done fighting. The choreographer should be sent to the ash heap of the pelicature. The fights in this movie are all over the place and do not hold well to any form of entertainment. There are a few fight scenes near the end, but the rest of the film is a mess.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is so bad it is a chore to watch. The characters are not even funny.<br /><br />I will be the one to recommend this one to no one. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a masterpiece. The story was written by Joseph Conrad himself, but the drama and the action are lifted from the famous novel. But without the background of a screenplay it can be said that the story has had a profound effect on the way we see the world. In a sea of darkness the black man makes a daring sea raid and the white men's lives are turned upside down. But the story remains undisturbed and it somehow works. I can't say enough about the fighting scenes. There is not enough of them, but they are intense. If there is one thing you should look for when watching this one you shouldn't really look for any action but for a profound silence. This movie manages to be beautiful but without pretentions. You'll be taken in, mesmerised by the way the film presents the human body. This is not to say, however, that the movie is without its faults. The story is a little too simple. There are too many characters and not a large number of them are interesting. The film has the advantage though in being able to focus and the scenes are powerful. If the film was cut down the effects get ridiculous, but don't let that stop you from watching it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ One of the biggest hits of this decade. An engaging story, great performances, great music, and a catchy \"just for London\" tagline. Great tunes, too, including the title tune, to boot. The film, too, is cast wonderfully: Mark Winshats of the BBC's Big Hit show is on-board, and stars the lovely, London-born Claire Danes, who I've been a fan of ever since her \"Girl, Interrupted\" turn in \"The English Patient.\" The rest of the cast aren't over the top: Daniel Craig is great as the charming and sensitive Thomas, as is Sophie Marceau as the doting Elizabeth, and there's little consensus on whether Peter Firth did his turn as Jonathan or Peter. But no doubt that's only because the film was made so long ago -- by which time, I guess, everyone has forgotten the script!<br /><br />But it's a very enjoyable film to watch, and also very charming, so don't miss it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ When I started watching this I was expecting a little something for my money but what I ended up getting was simply a waste of my time and I was even more frustrated when I had to turn off the TV. To call this a horror flick would be incorrect. None of the actors were scary and in the end I didn't even bother finishing the movie because there wasn't anything to finish. The monster looked like a bozo and the scenes were so cheesy that I actually took the movie a little bit too seriously... it wasn't a good movie at all. Overall I rate this 4 out of 10. I'm a fan of the 90's B- Horror and Sci-Fi and that's not what this was supposed to be. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ OK, here it finally is. I was on vacation with two of my friends one week, and we decided to finally watch some movies. So we picked this movie up at Costco for $2.99 and got home and it sat on the\n",

      " soft and very entertaining documentary film. I found it a lot of fun, and in some ways it reminded me of another documentary, NOTHING (2006) directed by Meryl Streep - SEEKING THE DARK STAR, which also stars Anthony Hopkins, Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei and Anthony Minghella. It's more a biography of Anthony Hopkins than this film, and I think it's one of the better documentaries I've thoroughly enjoyed recently. There are tons of interviews with people with whom they had a brief affair or relationship with and I think the best part of this is the music score by the amazing Liev Schreminski, who directed such films as AFTER THE shock (1982) and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY (1987). _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I can only assume that the people who made this film must have been at one time in the theater before it was produced; somehow they made an almost perfect movie that has nothing to do with anything in the literature. I like to think that it was the original intention of the writer to create a sort of fictional version of Herod's treacherous exploits, and to present it on a level more fitting of its original intention. But if that is indeed their intention, then you have to either seriously back off and die, or you will die rather than allow this movie ever to get out of your mind. I have nothing against Hollywood at all; I respect them for their movies that portray real life, but they can also be pretty ignorant in their approach to the writing of the screen. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I love all things Buster, from his incredible comic book hero, to the very awful and tasteless musical version of him and the film. The most disarming experience yet that the original MGM musical was a big disappointment. It's a true crime that Buster saved from being a total commercial failure in 1939 with a true creditable, if under-seen, musical and comic-strip hero in the lead. The plot? That was cancelled twice but never replaced in the theaters. It's such a shame. His best performance seems to come when he's in the middle of a verbal altercation between them that leaves him running the length of the theatre, then having to rescue himself at the last minute. Only one other person has such a big run in with him in the story's most classic scene--an explosion of sorts that makes the entire theater deaf and barely visible--and the rest of the screen only shows a few scattered shots of the screen outside the theater. <br /><br />This production of \"Bust-A-Buster\" was never marketed. Instead it is still one of the poorest films ever made. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The very thought that someone with so little talent could make such a terrible film was just a bit too much to bear. For starters, how did he get actors to agree to this movie?? <br /><br />And how could they get a script that looked and sounded as bad as this is? <br /><br />Also, with such a cast and a plot, how could the killer walk out to an audience?? The movie was very choppy in delivery: too much time spent on long faces for too much time spent on speech (even though there was a lot of it). <br /><br />The only thing that saved this film was the surprise ending. But even that was let down and could have worked the story a lot better. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie was terrible, the acting was poor, the plot was nonexistent, the way the woman was found was unbelievable, the way she died was stupid, there was not a single creepy image in the whole movie, most horror movie, even Halloween is scary. Plus, the scenes were poorly lit, it was very dull and there was not one scary scene in the whole movie, there is one the most disgusting person in the movie in the movie. I just can't tell anyone about this, I think you might be better off not viewing this movie, if you are under 13, but if you are over 18. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie made me question if I could live in a world without machines and computers. It said that technology is passing along too quickly -- if we retire, there will be no room for us to grow-- and it warned us of the dangers of polluting the environment.<br /><br />I have also noticed movies with similar themes ignore how their main characters act. In this film, the main protagonist takes some action but later gives some more back home, saying when his wife and family go for vacation, he should have done some more for his family to avoid being killed. The main antagonist in this movie is shown to be even more evil than in the first movie. He says he wants something like suicide, as if it were a\n",

      "SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I know, all you critics who have said that this is a good movie.<br /><br />That must mean it was the only movies which made me depressed in the past year and I'm writing this from the great viewpoint of this movie.<br /><br />For the first forty-five minutes, it's a light tragedy about young love, through songs and the great performance of Susan Sarandon. As the film progresses, it turns into a story about love, death and aging, about family relationships and our existence.<br /><br />This is a touching movie which is not \"trying to tell a story\" because it does not try. It simply gives us a story, and if you don't think that is a good story, you probably are an idiot.<br /><br />To this day, I still believe the movie to be a love story, and a sad, but fair one. Sarandon shows her love in a dramatic yet sensitive way, which makes her so realistic and sensitive. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This a very \"movie\" style of film that should appeal to a particular audience. It is not intended as a full blown \"screwball comedy\" but its combination with the visual and sonic imagery as well as the great ensemble cast make it something special.<br /><br />The cast is superb to say the least.<br /><br />Danny Glover, Richard Dreyfuss, Julia Roberts, Christopher Lloyd, Tina Fey, Leslie Mann, and much more. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A wonderful family film with love and respect.<br /><br />I saw this film for the first time this evening and found it to be a very enjoyable experience. The film follows the lives of a clan of sea people, from Alaska to Hawaii. The story and characterization is what makes this film enjoyable, while still maintaining some very serious topics like gambling.<br /><br />There are many dramatic scenes in the film, that weaves the plot along nicely, so that its very easy to follow. This includes some fantastic cinematography and sets.<br /><br />The story itself is a great story for any child or parents with any knowledge of sea travel and their loved ones. This is a story that can be enjoyed by kids as well as adults. <br /><br />The film features a wonderful backdrop of deep ocean scenery and a great story with realistic human actors, who do well and believably portray the story. They are extremely well chosen to play the key roles, with special praise due to the director and cast.<br /><br />An excellent, thought-provoking family film with a fun story and kids who just want to be loved and cared for. <br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I haven't seen the movie but I still can't believe it! It's the best movie of 2006 in my opinion. The movie is so original in it's own way that I've never seen anything like it. Also I have no issues with nudity (that really belongs to the 70's B movies) but this movie is so well done I cannot give it the same respect as something like Top Gun.<br /><br />The screenplay is just so brilliant and the direction is just so damn good. I have no idea what happened as the climax, but I don't think it was a hasty victory. I think the fans will be all too thrilled and a lot different from the first one. I mean it's too good, guys!<br /><br />Well, if you liked the script and I want you to see that movie I suggest you watch it. If you just want to see a great love story without the nudity I think you're missing out. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ For a film about an abandoned death camp that was resurrected with a host of other such evils, it is not exactly very watchable. There is hardly any artistry about this production. It is, however, a portrait of a world now devoid of those evils and, in the process, itself. It is not the portrait of a failed generation to be seen for its time so much as the portrait of one family struggling to survive with the trappings of success. It is this idea that the old society needed to be \"cleansed\" and made \"perfect\", and that such a society is no longer possible. Here we have a society that is so dysfunctional, even non-artistry at its worst ends. The idea that this new society (in the hands of the filmmakers) is somehow less \"than\" American is not just naïve, it is also deeply stupid. At the beginning of the film it begins, very innocently, with an explosion of the dead mothers. At the end, after the pain of such horror have set in, the\n",

      " the film with a bunch of old men playing old women in a house who are all dying from a mysterious root fungus. There are a few other sub-plots, but I would imagine that they are really insignificant in the grand scheme of the movie. The plot is never really explored. But, from what I gathered, it is pretty much a complete non-story. And, in every single scene, the actor's face is very close. But, in this scene was in fact very brief; in other words, the audience is left to guess which character this one is and what their relationship is, because the story is far too obscure. I have to admit that I didn't see the whole movie, that was probably a big disappointment for me. The only reason I gave this a 2 instead of 1 is because there is a very small scene where one of the old women has her breast bandaged. It's so very brief, but, the rest of the movie is pretty much what I would call porn. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ There is so much I liked in this film. It was funny, and moved me in a more loving way. I wish I had it yesterday, it felt like 10 years in a row... _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ My guess is that a group of friends, or worse... a small group of friends is the best they're able to come up with any decent idea, and that's why this film is so terrible, so the plot doesn't make sense, and the actors suck.<br /><br />I don't know what they were thinking, to put this in the synopsis. If you're looking for some great, talented, performers, then don't waste the money at the video store, and don't ask for more than you can get in a day's worth of watching this film, because it really isn't worth it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"The Matrix\" is based on the same series of novels written by David A. Miller and David W. Kelley, but was transformed into a movie along a few years later, as a result of several factors. The main reason is that it was put aside in favor of a new, big, complex, and original vision which didn't succeed on every level, as best as can be done, and which also had very strong \"commercial themes.\" I still think the film was just as much a commercial success as what \"The Matrix\" tried to be. The irony of the plot-- it makes no sense but also leaves you thinking why the hell it even got made--is that it gets a huge lift to make the world a better place. It was an extremely successful (unfortunately very limited) hit and the next big hit and \" Matrix Reloaded\" is in theaters now (which means we're going to have a big box office one next year-- unless it pisses someone off)<br /><br />The story has some holes in it. There's one involving the computer. In the real world, computers are a computer. I'm pretty sure everyone who's ever been fired from a company has been in this. I suppose to make the transition, but the writers apparently thought there might be other computer references too, so they created a computer reference. I think the writer also was busy the day this got greenlit and had nothing to review.<br /><br />The other thing I'm pretty sure The Matrix was not a factor in this film's making is the fact that it is a pretty damn hard movie to like and find, which really didn't help. The main problems were, a) pretty cliché and b) the script was almost incomprehensible(in the \"Who the hell did Conan/Warlock think the art of killing people/sneaking places?\" sequence I think I'm pretty sure one guy asked me, and I told him \"no way, that's not how you do it. You have to figure out the audience's reaction, I guess\". This guy obviously worked long hours for a crappy job and maybe his opinion wasn't the whole thing.) The final sequence, as I said, also had little if any connection to modern cyberpunk films (i.e. no Blade Runner influence) and because I'm sure Mr. Matrix doesn't know much else about how to write a plot, he basically just went off and created his own, almost-unexplained character.<br /><br />Anyway, overall I give this another 3/10 because it's not as bad as \"The Matrix.\" _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw the original movie in my prep school theatre years ago and while I appreciated it, it is by no means a great movie and really has a lot of issues. That's because the issues don't get stated or even addressed. As far as the movie goes, it's a very good movie but it's not for everyone. _S\n",

      "Right and for such people, the truth is stranger than the myths some filmmakers cling to. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The most interesting thing about this movie, for me, was the interaction of the participants. Sam and Jo are two characters that are not really explored (I won't say their names because they're probably too private!), so for this movie director and writer to take up two stories and introduce them in a two-hour movie without boring the audience about their respective characters is very smart indeed. The movie is interesting because of the various characters.<br /><br />The whole concept of having a dead grandmother, whom the two main characters live with in the end, is very personal. But who cares? It's not important to the story itself.<br /><br />One thing to note about this movie, and it says something about the movie industry, is that if you do a lot of movies, you have a lot of stories. You can see all kinds of stuff, because most of the stories aren't all that deep.<br /><br />Overall I give this movie a five, because it was a lot of fun, but not the biggest laugh of the movie, _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A great satire of a powerful military industrial complex.<br /><br />This is my all-time favorite movie, but I have seen it about maybe 20 times and it never gets boring. Every time I see it, it is hilarious.<br /><br />The jokes are often over the top, and a few others are downright silly like a few of these, but it isn't really about that, it's a great satire of a country that has never really had a political awakening. I think it's great that some people take comedy seriously, or see it as just a comedy movie for it's own sake, like many movies from the 70's and 80's. A satire that makes me laugh is just about the only thing that is truly amusing in this society, and it's not something Hollywood or the mainstream media wants. The people who write slam about this movie are the same people who can't accept the results of elections, or the people who are tired of hearing about police shootings or black on black violence incidents in daily life, or whatever other issues they care about. For people who care about that stuff, this is a real comedic treasure. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The movie starts with a bunch of women on a beach. They're not exactly singing and dancing, they use hand gestures and postures to communicate almost as much as we would in a high school acting class. They have very limited communication options since their relationship is just a series of mistaken identities and flashbacks. Most of the time they are unaware of their surroundings and just talk about stupid things. We follow the adventures of one of these women as she searches for and finds a cure for her amnesia and becomes a famous singer. This movie also provides useful examples of low budget effects and acting. The Amusement of Miss Kink, Miss Pansy, Alice in Wonderland, The Color Purple are all wonderful to listen to and watch. Even when talking quietly, they often talk faster than you hear and in a high-pitched voice. This movie will leave you laughing. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is one of the worst films I have seen.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer for this I was intrigued to hear it was about something similar to \"Candyman\" with Kevin Bacon and Jason Lee. The plot was interesting, but the special effects were awful, the only reason being the special effect for the dog who were the actors. The dog is obviously puppets with legs that turn because the script said they would do so. I sat there and turned the DVD off wondering, does this pack a punch? The thing looks like it cost 20 dollars and is just the tip the $0.50 in the special effects department.<br /><br />If that dog wasn't bad enough, the acting was very wooden, with the exception of the main actress who is always good, the dog however is not a good actor, and just didn't hold my attention. The guy who plays the general in charge of the dog facility is clearly a baddie and I didn't buy it as there were parts in the movie that could have been filmed in his home and the dog would look nicer on film and maybe even acted better in this picture compared to the home movie he shows the main actress in the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />The director seems to be very upset about Doggie being a big success because he went to film school and it's apparent he has no film up his own, if he has one. There is one exception from this movie which makes the movie as a 0/10 movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is one\n",

      ", this is a movie that could have been more. I think that people are tired of Hollywood movies that rely too much on violence and sex. There should be an end to the violent film genre.<br /><br />This could have possibly been a better movie. I was very disappointed by the acting, not because it was awful but because it was unbelievable it really could happen. The dialog was very weak, especially when dealing with a scene that did not exist. The fact that they took the law into their own hands and killed the police was not convincing either. I found the ending a little flat and they did not clarify if it was a pre-planned or spontaneous (a death, an illness, or death of a loved one) ending. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Not a bad movie though in a kind of feel-good kind of way. If you are a fan of the film series or the characters that portray them don't take the movie serious, that's fine. Just let them enjoy it! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The title story \"A Matter of Life and Death\" is so devastatingly brilliant and well-researched that it will bring tears to all those who loved it and will leave me with a profound smile upon my viewing its final moments. This is a story which, if told now, would give John Howard, Jr. some idea of the magnitude of what he has accomplished. I wish all of the film series to be made again as they are a valuable resource of historical fact. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie sucks so hard. I love a good cheesy horror flick, but this one is just so bad even I'd be embarrassed to watch it. How you could get the most stereotypical Hispanic \"dad\" and still not give the boy a little affection at least at the end is unbelievable. In real life a dad and boy could hardly have survived (not realistic) if they had been kidnapped first, so how did they do it with such a perfect accent? This could have easily been a lousy one to watch. You can never get the perfect scene down right, but it makes the movie.<br /><br />My advice to anyone who enjoys cheesy horror flicks: this one is just so bad that any good cheesy horror flick should be able to pull you in and make you laugh, and this was not that film. As if you needed to laugh through the whole thing, just turn it off, and watch the MST3K version.<br /><br />I can't even begin to describe it. This is pure fluff comedy from beginning to the end, with the MST3K style riff just a follow-up, of course.<br /><br />If you're really serious about seeing good comedy or even good drama, then stay away from this film at all costs because it sucked so much. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It's hard to write a negative comment about this \"film\". I really do not understand how it, with a title like, \"The First Family\", is released in the U.S. in March... it's not released in any Western country. They have tried to show the \"first family\" by putting the pictures out on the internet and some movies are never released in the U.S. and certainly not in the W.S. The movie's pictures are so poor that it is impossible to even make an attempt to understand it.<br /><br />It's really sad to see these bad pictures released in the U.S. so that politicians like the one who was responsible for this mess try to pass them through, and these \"great works\" are the most successful for that. This \"film\" has no pictures, no style (like the ones released in the U.K. for example), no heart, no beauty, no suspense, no action, no \"face\" (no matter what, it's just a mask), no nothing.<br /><br />It's so sad that people believe this kind of films are \"great\" and \"entertaining\".<br /><br />A \"real\" film should never be released, should never be shown, should never be made, nor shown anywhere. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ this is by far one the BEST horror movies I have ever seen, even if it is somewhat dated at the moment.<br /><br />how long do you need to think about a movie, before it can be really scary, even less, and that could be a pretty good thing?<br /><br />this movie works as a true horror movie, at least from an entertainment and entertainment point of view.<br /><br />the fact I did not really expect the movie to work or that I had to struggle for a good 5-20min it really is a good thing.<br\n",

      " HUMAN BEAUTIES was made as a prequel to this film, and it's a huge disappointment. In the world of modern movies, a film with Jean Harlow as Nancy is an absolute must. She was a very popular comedienne in the prime-era of Hollywood, and her unique charm and appeal in her films is beyond compare. If Harlow herself hadn't been Nancy O'Doig, she would have grabbed the audience's affection and given the movie a 10.<br /><br />Another thing I don't understand is how George Berger got involved in this film.<br /><br />I like most other people say that this \"film\" had a very good story, wonderful setting and fantastic cast, but then I have to think that most people who like films that are not a typical modern one, would find this a very bad movie. If you like movies that are more than average in a real way, then I really recommend you see this movie. The characters, both minor and major, have a very important part to play. The way the film is visualized is very good. <br /><br />I give \"Danger Signal\" a 9/10; it's a truly beautiful movie. So if you like cute romances or comedies with a little more evil than light comedy or action, then this is the film for you! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This was a great show. I was a huge JT McIver fan growing up, and when the show came on the big screen, I was a movie buff. The movies that the cast of this show made were classics, and with the movies that this cast did, like The One with the Dragon, The First Kid that Roared, The Kids that Roared 2-0, and finally The Family that Counts has to be on!<br /><br />The biggest reason this show was so good was the cast and the story lines. The cast and story lines were so memorable and the plot and plot were just a hoot. Every episode was so entertaining. You could love everything from the beginning to the end and it was all a hoot for me. This was a show that you could watch more than a few times and just fall in love with every episode. The cast was so likable that you could get hooked. It has everything from the sexy, the sexy little girl, the fat kids, the little girl that runs after her, the girl with glasses and her friends, the teen mother, and the spoiled old rich girl. The voice actors did a great job. The voice actors for JT McIver and all the cast added a lot of fun to the show, which is why this show keeps going strong after the series ending. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ So, I wanted to see what all the hype was about when I borrowed this movie from the library. I was in for a pleasant surprise: it was the most entertaining movie I've ever had the misfortune to see.<br /><br />It's well-written, well-acted, and--yes--funnier. There are scenes where the \"rules of comedy\" can be broken (i.e., stealing other people's money--following the original premise of a blind person investing $1,000,000 for a film--is a bit cringy), but those situations are funny (the \"golden peanut\" scene coming to life is hilarious).<br /><br />I know it's summer, but I don't think that it was necessary to bring up the flagrant anti-Jewish slant IN the film (the scene where Danny DeVito is making his customary \"I'm a CHURCHED Jew\" presentation, and the other \"judy meter\" scenes are humorous). Still, I've watched this movie many times, and I never got tired of it. I give it a resounding 9 stars. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ After seeing many movies, the first thing that comes to your mind is \"how did this director/editor get financed to make such a bad film.\" My best guess is that they used some kid from a low-income neighborhood who walked out on their dime, since the film was a free concert. You see it with some crappy camera and guess what? THAT'S IT! They just made a lousy movie! Don't follow my advice and rent something more valuable like watching paint dry. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ While not quite as good as the original, this is still a good movie. Sure the acting is not that great, but for a very different concept - a \"family therapist\" than most big studios have. If you want a film with a twist to it....don't bother. It is just action, which in my opinion is much better than what was found in the first installment. It's more of\n",

      "os, she had great taste in men. She did have a sweet tooth, but that was also seen throughout the series. She didn't really get laid by the book, but that's okay, because she clearly was drawn to the more sensuous side of men. She really wasn't the \"hottie\" one. In this, she truly had a face to make things happen by being the \"all around good girl\" for a little while. There's not much of a plot to speak of (even on the film itself, there is), and this is probably why it's such an awesome series. The women are not all the starlets, and they are not all great at playing them either, but I like it, partly because I can watch some classic television series again and again, and this one is a lot like it. I also like how they have done some things well such as the movie and the movie guest starring Dennis. They have used the same set of clothes ever since the first episode on the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it's really comical. If you're interested in a film like this, it's a good idea to watch it with an open mind, just don't take it seriously and because you know how it'll end. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am a huge fan of the book. I think this movie is even worse then the book, at least it is easier to understand. The writing in this movie is so bad. I know that this isn't the fault of the actors, it's more that they are the best actors they could find to carry this movie. You would think, from the title, that it has a very good book to it, but this movie has no plot, the characters are dull, the way they are is just wrong. They don't even look alike, and that's the really sad thing, when there are actors who are even worse than them... and they're well known! I really don't see what this story is all about, why does it have to be about these two people? Maybe it's about the guy getting the girl in the end. I think this has nothing to do with sex. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I loved this movie even when I'm trying not to like it. When I hear \"trampers\" I usually associate those with good movies. But there is an evil in this. A very easy way to destroy a movie. A couple of things to begin by start of bashing this movie:<br /><br /># One , the acting is awful. The girl plays a trampers, an obnoxious one. What makes it worse is the way the kid is portrayed.<br /><br /># Two , The story is very simple- bad people become good people. You cannot believe such a naive thought by the actors, who are certainly not rich of imagination.<br /><br /># Three , the script is simply too stupid. In it people talk a lot and act like mindless creatures. The movie could be about the girl, and the friend, but it's simple. It's not. People of that day and that night talk about the rain, and the thunder, and the ice cold snow. They're simply not intelligent being. The movie is not only a disaster, but it's an insult to the intelligence of the audience.<br /><br /># Four , the ending is too dumb. There must be a message. It's not there. One man says: I did not find that movie to be hard. Four wrong words: you didn't find that movie funny.<br /><br />I hope you understand how this movie hurt me, not to much, but as it has got the meaning. It simply hurt me. It made me angry, and I needed a big kick in the rectal area, in the movie's shame.<br /><br />My conclusion: if you're looking for a good trampers movie, go ahead. This is nowhere close to that. 1 out of 10- It's not even funny. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have seen this film several times. The acting by the entire cast is superb especially that of Jean Simmons as Aunt Bee (Cameron Diaz). I am a big fan of BABYLON 5 and I must say the characters in this film are just great especially Simmons. The special effects are top notch. If you haven't seen BABYLON 5 then do yourself a great favor and watch it before Sunday night when nothing interesting happens. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I love all the Spaghetti Westerns, The Big trail is outstanding. It is filled with great atmosphere and great action. It is like one big story without the stupidity of most spaghetti Westerns. It is an excellent spaghetti western with excellent action and humor, and a story which is something like The black Baron,\n",

      ". _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie was a piece of poo. From beginning to end, it stinks like a giant fart in a big bowl of piss mixed with manure. If I were forced to choose between watching a movie called \"Coconut Milk & Coffee\" and watching this piece of garbage, choose the former choice sensibly. This movie is the grandaddy of all movies in the genre, right up there with Titanic, Apollo 13, The Man with the Golden Arm and Saving Private Ryan. It's pure unadulterated fecal matter of course, but there isn't anything redeeming in this production. I could not find one scene where I could smile in the course of sight. The acting is beyond bad, even for 1949's film. What is worst is the script. There is NO plot that could be called entertaining at all. And no good acting can save that. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ There is another great horror movie called Hold the Hand. I liked Hold the Hand and those other two movies but I think the Ninja's is better. In my opinion, Hold the Hand is a better movie.<br /><br />Ninja's Story is about the Cold-Years team of Dr. Kondo and Mr. Sakata, who has developed nuclear weapons after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. One of his members is Lt. Hosein Nishinani, who is supposed to be brilliant in nuclear research. One day on a cold winter night, a friend of theirs gets thrown into prison by the government and all they find is their old comrade Nishinani's lifeless body and the mysterious letters in his head. Soon, the friend is found out and brought back to life.<br /><br />The premise of this movie sounds intriguing, and its a great premise for a movie. However, the idea of the government using these \"Ninja's\" to wipe out entire continents is ridiculous.<br /><br />Hold the Hand is one of the worst movies I have seen in my entire life, and I've seen some great movies. Don't bother with this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I've usually been pretty generous with my ratings... but this \"film\" is terrible! The acting is wooden and trite, and the plot is trite. I have no idea how to rate anything else. I'm not even sure what \"quality\" is: amateurish or amateurish? I'd take a pass on this one even if it were not a peer film. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ For those who have no idea what Cockney or working class London is in the late 40's or early 50's, then here is an advert from the then home secretary, Margaret Thatcher reminding us how much richer we were than the average working class household, or that the Government was a joke, but still trying to live up to Thatcherites standards.<br /><br />As a working class Londoner for over 25 years, I still remember the indignities that working class people in London experienced during the 40's and 50's under Thatcher, the so called \"free love\" movement which didn't last very long and wasn't much fun. At the time, this movement seemed even more bitter than the Thatcherite movement of the the the 50's which turned out to be quite different to the one described by Blair et al.<br /><br />But Thatcherites like me would mourn and be saddened by these working class indignities but Cockney mulch was much cleaner, much cleaner, and much cleaner linen.<br /><br />However, in this film, Cockney seems just a bit more Victorian for once, in contrast to the rest of it.<br /><br />And, having failed to get the working class to accept any Thatcherite reforms at all, Thatcherites are depicted as misogynistic, racist, uneducated, dirty, and just a bit too matronly.<br /><br />I would have preferred a less Dickensesque depiction of Cockney life and working class London.<br /><br />So, for those wanting a lesson in London reality, then here's Margaret Thatcher herself talking up the working class and calling them all dirty English toads. And, while she was well over a decade older, she was still a bit puffed but a bit too old.<br /><br />And here is Margaret Thatcher herself in her later years, praising the \"purdles of London\", and how her ideas about protecting their pathetically inadequate public schools would help her country.<br /><br />So, these guys at the British Museum had no idea what Margaret Thatcher was all about, and they still consider her worthy of their time and effort. That's the irony. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ There was a lot of hype about this film. It had all the reviews of Cannes\n",

      " as is the case with many of those movies where the main character/singer/actress is very badly matched to the actor in the film/sport. In my opinion, I can think of so few movies where an unfortunate match of talent/singer or actor doesn't result in a great film. This movie was not only painful to watch, but also very painful to listen to. Don't see it. It didn't do a lot for me. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ A very good film and a bad one at that. It takes a while to get going, but by the time Michael Madsen and Jeff Bridges are together, I was completely drawn into this movie. It is an odd blend of Madsen and Bridges, and it might be too far fetched for many people, but the combination of Madsen and Bridges in a supporting role seems pretty darn plausible. The characters are solid and it really made me care for the actors (especially Bridges, who seems real and M Madsen isn't!). I like Jeff Bridges, but he was really lost in this film. I couldn't help but think, \"Is that really why he's like that?\" But somehow he really just seems cold-blooded, so there's no connection. I think of people who are drawn to this film like I was, and the only thing which made it seem real was the visual design or the atmosphere. I enjoyed watching the film, but would recommend it, although it would not make a great film viewing experience. I will probably watch it again, so this is a tough one to rate. It really is a great film to watch, especially if you enjoy the acting. It's worth an eight out of ten! (out of ten!) _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I can say with confidence that I've only seen this one (though I've been to Vietnam so it was only one years back); this one is great and if you are a fan of war movies, will say it's great even though sometimes, war movies fall a little flat. I mean, it's obvious that the US was doing it but it's also a very war-is-evil theme. And, there is an excellent cast: Sean Connery (probably best known for \"Gandhi and Gandhi\"), Elizabeth Hurley (best known as the lead in George Bailey's \"Actors' Studio\"), Jonny Lee Miller (from \"The Green Berets\" movies, and an underrated big time action fan favorite \"The Terminator\") John Lithgow (again best known as the kid from \"Family Ties\"), Kris Kristofferson, and Kevin Spacey (in a role in a movie about a soldier). This is just great. The movie tells the story of a bunch of soldiers who are sent to a secret location (Vietnam), have a mission to retrieve something and what happens there surprises me. It turns out that they have come to a secret bunker and everything is ready; and, the \"vietnam\" effects are there, but they are there as a surprise. So, this movie just, I think, fits in well in my collection of Vietnam C4F movies; one of my favorites, and, I say again, \"A must-see\". _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This film is so out of proportion that at first you wonder what it is about. The opening title makes it very clear that it is a horror film - a story set around the effects of a large derelict building in a deserted island. You are then led through a story into a very claustrophobic world.<br /><br />The film was obviously made in a hurry and the story moves from horrific to quite humorous within moments. I have no idea how it got an rating of 7.0 in the UK but I can't imagine anyone scoring it higher. It is very strange that such a well made film about such a small idea should be rated so poorly.<br /><br />Watch this film if you can: it will keep you watching, entertained and perhaps learn something about cinema (or just about anything for that matter). _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I can understand the reason. I can even appreciate a film making that could take a simple premise and stretch it until it becomes such a complex and convoluted story that the audience might as well just go along for the ride. I understand. And I understood the desire of Jeff Lieberman, but I can also imagine the writers thinking: gee, these characters have such cool nicknames and names that are loaded with meaning. Now they just happen to be having their conversations in front of our eyes as well. So let us name some of their situations. Okay. Let Jeff Lieberman take this situation and stretch it. He becomes a character and a very effective one. The fact that we watch him constantly makes the film easier because we see him. His friends are also more interesting.\n",

      " />Just how bad could it be? If the movie was about two people getting ready to get married (instead of three) and one of them is cheating on her and the other is cheating on her at the altar (yes, the bartender, not the actual wife that they slept with at the end) would it be any less interesting than the two people getting stoned and bickering for an hour and a half? Well, it would be. But I digress. If it is supposed to be a 'biographical' look into the life of one fictional person and her life in the way some people describe it (which I understand is what some of the other reviewers are talking about but it is an oversimplification and the film belongs in Z-Grade horror), then it is very, very wrong. Not only is the dialogue painfully shallow and unprofessional (\"Hi, Mr. So-and-so. How's your looking?\") and the acting worst by far (Mary Steenburgen's performance here is so bad that I actually looked away from the screen at several points). If the movie goes for comedy and succeeds despite these unprofessional shortcomings, then I have a very hard time not feeling angry because the movie is just so awful and unrealistic. On the other hand, if the movie is actually a serious study into one fictional person and her life, it gets three stars and they're all justified. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I am not the fussy kind and I have watched a large number of films in my day, but I have to say that this one really does rank amongst the very best of the lot...I think I have always been amazed by the versatility of the lead actors, the plot, direction and the lighting in all of their respective roles and this film has stood the test of time to be consistently entertaining. I really hope one day to make a documentary of a quiet type of film to be shown in the future as I would really enjoy interviewing someone as exceptional as Ewan McGregor. The best aspect of this movie is that like the original Korean War film 'Burning Target' which was a landmark film in that it demonstrated the human side of the enemy and the heroism of those that put the lives - and the limb dragging along the way - of thousands of men, women and children in harm's way just as a warning of how the enemy would go for their lives. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ There's another kind of film about WWII that nobody seems to have seen (if there is one I haven't seen) and it's fairly influential on me. The film's title is taken from an Edna Ferbers poem (\"The Last Post of the Warring States\") while an unnamed Canadian girl called \"Kathy\" (played by Rosanna Arquette) falls in love with a Searing Knight. And Kathy is sent to Vietnam. So what does Kathy do? Oh, wait, she picks up a pair of binoculars and goes to Saigon to look for her lost love. Meanwhile, her two American friends have piled into a van and driven over a dangerous defacement bomb that is about to go off. The explosion totally misses the truck, however, so they get lost in the jungle. Now I'm not going to say whether this is the funniest scene EVER (lucky couple didn't laugh when they saw it coming).<br /><br />Anyway, the story is pretty obvious to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of military history, specifically naval aviation, but if you've read anything about the movie, it doesn't make even that much sense. However, the writing and acting are outstanding and there are some hilarious lines here and there... The best bit is, of course, Rosanna Arquette and her trademark \"The Last Post of the Warring States\", which is one of the best war movies ever made.<br /><br />If you don't have the latest Hollywood gossip on background psychology and the machinations of war, I highly recommend reading my book \"Never Been Kissed\" by Stephen Ambrose. More detail about the film's background and plot is in there as well. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I rented the video of 'Under Suspicion' not expecting much, but was very surprised. This movie is excellent. It is not as graphic as people have said, but the story is great. It is based on a true story and it is a great insight into an important character. I also feel as if the acting and direction in this movie is not often done in the Horror genre. The acting is superb for this type of movie and everyone involved is a talented person. I hope to see this movie in the theaters soon, the video is almost available. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I went to see this flick with high hopes and a great idea in mind: a martial arts action adventure starring Bruce Lee. Unfortunately the film didn\n",

      " Buster. As always, though, this is a very downer film. It's a very downer film, to put it mildly. It might interest you to know that although it is considered a cult-movie, it was never considered a major movie-classic; the most recent version of the story-line might best be found in the final story-line featurette on the DVD. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"Shit Happening\" is one awful movie, but it manages to be even worse than that. The screenplay has no style, the directing is lousy and the cinematography is nothing special. It is obvious that an awful amount of money was spent on this film, because it looks nothing like an \"art work\" and could easily have been an early script to go through the millstones of late. The characters have no chemistry and the story is so predictable and cliché that it becomes annoying. The script does not go any where. It also does not have any of the original's original humor. This film had a lot of the feel of cheap cheap sex jokes and jokes that are so cliché that your average Joe watching this is not laughing too much. A lot of the scenes were already shot in crap-o-brick fashion and are just being dragged into the film. <br /><br />The worst of it is with the lead character, whose name is Alex, and his friend, whose name is Finn. Finn is the kind of guy that nobody could ever have believed he would be a real alcoholic, but he is. This girl isn't really drunk either. She's not even that sperky with her friends.<br /><br />Finn actually has some talent to tell the story. Some actors, or at least in part, were in stage fright. Still, none of them did much to help this film. If it weren't for the fact that this film is so bad, you would leave it playing in the fridge. The only parts not done completely poorly is one flashback. I was kind of relieved when it ended since I had actually seen the film in my rental. But, just to add a little more to this film is very unnecessary is the ending is so ridiculous. It is obviously done with no thought to the end and the ending is not what it should be, not being the whole story. It is also the worst ending of the three, coming after the two minutes that they were in the theatre opening and just after they left the theatre. <br /><br />Overall, this film is a bad movie with bad writing and acting. This is so bad that it has ruined the movie that should have been in the movie theaters. <br /><br />PS- Check this out for a laugh. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ One can only imagine that in this era of violent movies and a post-Sweeney, post-Katrina Ostermann-inspired zombie 'horror film', this film might be a bit of an embarrassment...<br /><br />I couldn't help being drawn to this film throughout, not least because I am a fan of the old B movies and this certainly does not match that. But the acting is a flop and 'actor turned movie star' is not only a shame but it also puts all that good-ass-actor rubbish to shame.<br /><br />This movie is basically an excuse for B-movie slasher extraordinaire extraordinaire Randy Quaid to show off his acting talents: he plays the main, madman villain of the piece... but with no script of his own. At least, it was in his hand! It seems that this guy has now been down the drain for a while...<br /><br />A must of quale be given... but don't say I didn't forewarn aye. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I'm amazed that this stuff is still in theaters. I was born in 1953 in St.Louis, Missouri, yet I can still give this state a bad name. I guess, I can even look at the faces of my friends (1949-present) who proudly show this dishonor by their participation on this filthfest. I couldn't believe that a movie that displays the pride of St.Louis and New Bern at the expense of ANY OTHER STATE can be shown on video, let alone to the general viewing public here in the greater Greater Saint Louis area.<br /><br />I had just started watching the reruns of the show a few months ago. I heard about the movie being shown on the next Cable, just where I live in Saint Louis. So, I finally found a way into the store to rent what is deemed to be the worst film ever to be filmed. You might as well call it a bad dream, because the film looks like an incomplete draft of the script. I am still baffled by my friend's comments that\n",

      " don't really understand, but you should. The acting is good, but it's no worse than something you'd see on a TV program that's supposed to be comedy. I can't claim that these films are anything other than cheap TV and that I enjoyed watching, but they were cheap to make, it has to be said, it's hard, but also impossible, it seems to have been a very very long wait, for the most part, to get the actors to work again, when they aren't busy being the stars of movies and television. The script is so cliched one has to wonder if it's actually written by one of the co-stars of \"Mortuary\",(and that's not saying much, either). I also think that the soundtrack, the beautiful country songs, and the music would have been better suited for the theatre or for a TV presentation. So, let me reiterate, don't go see \"Wicked Little Things\", but if you're viewing this on a TV, make sure you have the volume turned up, and you've got some entertainment. The story was adequate, the acting was adequate, the music fitting (if you haven't seen the movie). I did like the first two and a half hours though, I felt like there was room for a little more action and carnage, as a result of the lack of background music, and that they were relatively quick paced. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film is based on a true story, and follows a real love story.<br /><br />This is an interesting story that we hope to see used in Hollywood (as other commentators have pointed out), but this is a good film in it's own right.<br /><br />It deals with murder, justice is not done, and a few things in it are true to life.<br /><br />We hope to see this film used for an end to forgetful crime film. In this case, a killer is portrayed at the end, but all of them do go to show just how unfair and nasty, and not even very funny, our justice system can be.<br /><br />The direction in there is definitely the main thing. I really liked the story and told it in pretty simple English; the action seems to happen just to show the brutality this world has towards a killer. I also tried to find subtlety in the dialogue and plot here to make it stick even more.<br /><br />I liked the acting, especially from the real criminals, but I don't want to give too much away. We can see the desperation when they are thinking they'll get away with it, but they still go for it. It's worth watching if you can get your head in the right place though.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like was it was in the early scenes, they could of been a whole lot better. They start off well, you could tell they are serious when they start talking about taking someone just to be forgotten. But the rest of the movie, after they run out of bullets, the acting really gets stupider.<br /><br />We hope to see this film used in Hollywood. But you've got to give the makers credit; we saw this film in the cinema, and we were surprised to see it stay in place.<br /><br />We hope to see this film used for something more thoughtful crime writing. But we have to be realistic; this film doesn't even have the heart and drama for an action flick.<br /><br />Bravo and really well done to the director, he knows nothing we don't know.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Well, I haven't watched every flick in the history of movies, but this is my favorite so far. What makes it outstanding is its perfect combination of action, adventure, suspense, comedy and romance. Don't forget though, it is also a good story. One of, if not the best, of all time. A must see for any movie lover! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ First of all, I hated the movie. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, I just cringed.<br /><br />I hated the acting of everyone, of every variety and I mean EVERYONE. But, I did not see evil, I did not see murder. Oh, I did see makeup in the movie, but I did not see murder. Oh, I saw a little skin, but I did not see murder.<br /><br />I did see the first murder, yes, I did. It was a poor choice by the director. I am telling you the name of this movie: The Cracking Experiment.<br /><br />That being said, I have never been a fan of extreme movies, but this can be considered extreme in the same way movies like Extreme Pestil\n",

      " the best movie ever. This movie can be watched with 3 group of friends and it's more fun than 90% of all the b-films out there. The movie takes place in a period where everyone has lost what is thought to be money in savings and the banks have wrecked it, so they need to keep it full of junk so the banks can't lose too much. The jokes in the movie, even if they did originate with the 99% of the movie's audience, are the best and most clever, and will have you stomping the floor with laughter throughout the movie. It's a comedy, and a good one at that. When people ask how they can watch any movie, my answer is always \"By laughing.\" It's true that a lot of comedies are a lot of things, and a lot of them are not always funny, but you HAVE to stop and think to yourself, \"What is a laugh? What is a good cry?\" and this movie really makes you think and is very touching. I'd give 10 out of 10 stars if I could...<br /><br />Don't miss this one. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is absolutely amazing! I loved this movie from the very beginning till the very end. I had read these guys have good taste in their movies, since my mom rarely ever watches them. Well, I'm hooked now. I watched the DVD just now and just loved it. I haven't gotten the ending. I am a gay and wanted to watch this movie after my high school got a AIDS epidemic and I had no one in my graduating class to watch it. This is a great choice for a gay person to watch it. It will show you why it only lasted for a year and a half. So many movies in a world of crappy movies, this one tops it. I want to go out and get my own copy now. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ After I've seen the whole movie (and I thought it was one hour long), I felt I was forced to see it. I don't mind \"mindlessly\" watching a movie to get a sense of how the Japanese were at the time of the film (I think it's very nice and a very effective way to look at it, too), but when they're just talking idly, or talking idly, or even just talking idly back and forth, I really want to feel the movie.<br /><br />The story was pretty basic, and it was certainly not original. When a man has been caught committing a crime, he is put in jail, to be beaten and starved and, ultimately, become unconscious. When he awakens, he discovers that there are people living in his prison. One day, while he is out in the forest, he is attacked by a man whose eyes, presumably, were marked (in some way) with the rainbow flag. Naturally, he doesn't pay attention to the pain in this man's eyes and he is killed (as we'll soon see). The man, of course, has his eyes marked with a rainbow flag, and he is determined to take revenge on the murderer, not as an individual, but as a means of affecting change in society.<br /><br />There is a bit more to it, of course. I won't mention plot details, but you can see the man's changes after he's seen one of the attacks (or, more precisely, the one attack only). He becomes a rebel and, naturally, he changes. He changes, too, so that the man who killed him can take revenge on him, too. He also takes some time away from his family and the society he's left. It seems that the only change in the man's life is that he now has a body (of course, something he has failed to get in the last couple of years). Maybe he can take some time away from society and its demands. If so, he should try taking some time away from his body.<br /><br />Of course this is only one possible view, of course, and I didn't get any answers to my questions, because the man's change isn't shown, only inferred, from this episode alone. However, it is very interesting to watch this man struggle with his body and his desire to go back to normal; his transformation is clearly done through the depiction of the people in the movie, through visualizations of their bodies, and so that I really enjoyed it and was willing to suspend my disbelief, even though I don't know what will happen next.<br /><br />So: a man who was always rebellious but was unable to cope even with the \"normal\" things in his life (including relationships with his partner and mother) now has a body, a mind, and an overall sense of freedom and fulfillment. Also, a woman who was in love with each other throughout the whole of his childhood isn't shown in\n",

I have never seen a film where the characters walk/run/swam through the woods like they are...but they were just there waiting for their little moment of adventure and were stopped by something, any time. This was filmed so many times it had quite a bit of back story that we only see in the movie now. You never feel the involvement of the characters in the movie since we only see the battles. So if you are looking for action and a new style of film making, then this is not what you would be looking for. You would probably get the same reaction from others if I was you. But if you have an imagination, some imagination and can stand a film that is not all action and fancy camerawork you should see this film. But be warned, even if you like movies with no blood and gore this one is not for you. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The show I don't really follow is the Michael call the game but I thought it was pretty hilarious, the reason I'm going to post is because I'm a sports fan and this guy's character wasn't in that. I think he might probably be the funniest drunk I've ever seen in my life.<br /><br />If you get a chance to watch the game and if you're a sports fan I would recommend drinking and there are a few funny parts in there which I've never thought before.<br /><br />I also love how there are a million movies that are probably undervalued, there's a real deal that was done about years ago but haven't really been done much. I'll probably buy that, that and one of my other favourite parts is to type in 'numbers' or 'diploa' into google maps. This show is hilarious, you must see if you're in the mood for lists and lots of fake sports betting locations. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This was among my few outings into India, to see the range of character and taste of all cast. Not that I don't have favorites over here, but for me the most pleasant was Sivaji (Darshan Dhar) and the girl from Anupam (Nisha Kothari) as the bride. Of course those, for a change, do not differ much from any other characters. As with the characters, in no way did I feel different after each episode. The actors worked very hard with the script and even though the series ends on a very low note, this is still not enough to stop me from watching every series. There were some disappointments, such as the lack of any background music for the characters, but these have given it an almost unique look and i would guess an attempt to give the series an aura of taste. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ When the Soviet commandos invade Afghanistan, the Americans send their men in the army, known as \"The Rangers\". They are defeated and captured. This makes the American commander (Joel McCrea) the superior one.<br /><br />I would've had to write a lot had I not read the original source (in fact, it was the French movie \"Le Boucle Antoine\" which I watched). It has to be called something else once they started using it.<br /><br />The movie suffers from its inanity (and I do mean inane). The commandos are in no way Marines. In no way do they bear any sort of instrument on their helmets, but a few soldiers with automatic rifles fire up the side like they were aiming. As soon as they get within firing distance of the Rangers, they bolt up screaming like crazy with iron sights. As soon as their rifles fall within range of the Rangers, they open up with automatic weapons on. As soon as their rifles fall within range of the Rangers, they fire and kill the Rangers with iron sights.<br /><br />Then I get to the part that really annoyed me: the Rangers are shown getting help from the Americans and the Rangers rescue the day after they fall into their ambush; the Americans don't bother them! But they just let them help them and then just stand there, looking puzzled.<br /><br />This has got to be the most nonsensical part of the movie. If you go out to a beach and rent a bunch of trash, there's a greater chance that you'll see some girl with a torn shower cap than a bunch of old Rangers without weapons. But on the other hand, you may also see the word \"Ranger\" on the beach sign. It's impossible for me to imagine how stupid, ludicrous and unbelievable that is, when I have seen dozens of movies with similar lame old town-scum. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have watched this movie at least a thousand times that I can positively say that it\n",

      " so in the beginning of each episode you can tell that this show is gonna be terrible, but it is a pretty good idea to give it a chance before burning it. It got decent ratings at first, and it built up for great ratings. I can't really tell anyone how good this series really is. You've got to be patient, and you've got to like what is on screen for it to take. When something catches your eye, you will probably keep watching it, but you will probably wonder, why did the ratings not blow that many off this show right then and there for years to come. My advice is to watch in moderation. I think if you like a few great episodes, just watch the rest, and you will be just fine.<br /><br />I think they have some great new stuff, in the episode where a woman gets hanged. I loved it, and I'm gonna go see it for sure.<br /><br />9/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A friend said that if I saw a copy of the cover of this movie in the movies at the theater I would never walk out. so needless to say I have yet to do so.<br /><br />this movie sucks.<br /><br />the cast sucks.<br /><br />the direction sucks.<br /><br />and the dialogue sucks.<br /><br />if you are gonna make this movie, make it in order to win a competition, like michaele ever was involved in that contest. or if you are gonna make a movie about a war, don't make it about nato rima or war god.<br /><br />I am not gonna go too deep into why this movie sucks, becuase that is a waste of time. but some movies go down, sometimes stars go down. so for the rest of u r what this is: bad acting, bad writing, bad things. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a movie that doesn't really fit into any genre. If one searches up to the title page of this movie in Hollywood, California it is \"The Man\" - yes, it's that name. But, that about sums it up. Man wants to marry girl with whom he is alone. He tries, but she rejects him. He can't marry her by putting up her nightgown on a chair and he makes several moves to get her to go back to her sister. Eventually, he has a chance with her at a party - the date is unimportant since he already knows her and she only cares about the day. So says the story and I agree. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ When I first seen this film, I thought it was fantastic, but later on, after I watched it, I was shocked that a movie could actually be this bad.<br /><br />The script does not deliver anything worth watching, as well as the characters, the only reason you would watch it was to see what would happen if you threw a frying pan near a certain TV station. <br /><br />The film has a lot to do with a group of women who have a plan to commit seppuku (a highly dubious and illegal ritual that entails the female samurai). With this plan, it would be possible for any number of reasons, from mental to financial, or just plain weird.<br /><br />The cinematography, or lack thereof, is of the highest quality. The camera angle is incredible, the scenes are well-balanced and, perhaps worst of all, the music is the best thing in the film. To quote the film, \"if you can't hear the theme music, it's best not to take the soundtrack\". The film contains the rare gem of a romance that doesn't develop into a sex-fest.<br /><br />So, if you can't get enough of that, and you are a guy, beware of this film. If you prefer your movies dark, with a real sense of dread, beware of this film. Unless you like to look at things in dumb, straight-forward terms. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I can't understand why anyone wouldn't like this movie, it was just so good.<br /><br />A friend rented it, thinking it was some old classic 80's junk that would make fun for the teenagers. I think the reason why people give it some 2 stars is because they think that the violence is too much. It probably started off that way, and it's still a really great movie. If it was rated D, it would probably be a little more dangerous than it is. As for people under 12, it's not that violent, it's just really, really corny. There's also bad taste in the acting, no real real actors in it. There are also scenes that really are too corny.\n",

      "atography and a lot of CGI in the final battle. Now, compare that to the brilliant, sweeping, cinematic epic \"Mortal Kombat\", the same year. Sure, the CGI is cool for certain sets, but the whole film has a whole lot more of the style and substance. \"Return of the Fives\" really delivers all the essential elements that make an excellent graphic novel - strong story that grows to connect and engaging, fun, exciting action. The story here is really original, with a lot of twists and turns, which keeps it in perspective compared to most films. And it's fun, which is what a film like this should strive for. This is one of the few films that, despite being over two and a half hours, still holds my interest throughout - definitely one of the classic \"What if?\" films in cinema history. **** out of ***** _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was a little worried during my viewing of this movie, not because i am a huge John DeLorean fan but because I always enjoy his movies a little more when compared most others.<br /><br />My friend let me watch this movie with him, and despite the fact that the movie was a little boring and slow, after 30 minutes I was hooked.<br /><br />30 mins after that I was completely lost in the world unfolding before me. I could not help but think of all the little clues that this movie possessed. \"The first person you see who dies...is the one who's gonna live...\" \"The river god is in his underground lair...\" it was amazing to me how things always worked out and how his character would find his own solution...the solution...of course...no explanation given...you have to watch it for yourself.<br /><br />I was not one of those people that couldn't wait to watch the next scene, and when the movie ended I felt completely satisfied, I had seen it all. I loved the ending and the entire movie I could not live without, the one where she wakes up from her dream...well done.<br /><br />For those of us that had waited a long time to see JDL you don't owe it to yourself to stay awake. Because it won't matter what happens to you.<br /><br />I have to write more...this...after all the clues the movie would never have mattered to me if it wasn't for this amazing, captivating and captivating movie. I had my doubts after the end, but I was proved wrong of course.<br /><br />As far as action-cinema coming from Mexico...well if you are looking for a good action-movie this movie may not be for you. But just give this Mexican movie a try and you will find it well worth your time. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A little film that tries to be a little too complicated for its own good but ends up being pretty entertaining nonetheless. What makes this so special is the acting of Gere and the beautifully shot location shoots that take place there. A few other standout parts also make up for the overall simplicity of the film. Even though a film like this might be a little heavy on the visual side it is still, essentially, a good piece of entertainment value. 8 out of 10 stars. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ this was a great film, i saw it at the theatre when i was 10 or 11 and loved it, also i would love if any of my friends could watch it because it is one of my favourite movies that is in my top 5. I am not a film-literate person,, but i think if they want a little educational it would be just too much for them, but my favourite film of all time would definitely be this one! you will do just as well reading the comments. the film itself is fun in parts, but also has some disturbing material. i would suggest that if you do want a real educational film,, i would suggest that see it, but also don't watch it if you are sensitive! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I could not agree more. This is not what is advertised on the box. This is a real thriller. It scares you during the act, but that's the point. There was nothing else that was scarier than this movie. I'm actually sad it is rated as low as it is, cause it is definitely on the top grossing grosser list. And it is a good grosser! All the actors are great. So, you have a killer Halloween night! Now, lie down, secure your seat and enjoy! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I just have to warn you: If you do decide to rent this movie because you like Chris Rock, avoid it. It lacks his natural comedic timing that makes him a big attraction on stage, and it lacks his visual comedic timing\n",

      " _END_REVIEW_ A lot of people seem to hate this movie, and I can see where they're coming from. But I'm here to tell you that it's a very, very good movie. There are so many little details, so many plot turns, and the acting is top rate. The story is pretty well crafted too, with some clever twists. The story also seems to go hand in hand with the music, in that the more songs you've probably heard before hearing the words \"One Blue Thing\" used there's more chances that you'll get all of the meanings, such as the name of the baby that gets named Sophia, she's like the one you never wanted your daughter to be named after. To me, it's a pretty genius way to present music and emotion. A movie just isn't complete without a story to back it up, and while I appreciate the concept behind the movie, I feel that a great story has to tell the story too, not just the end result. This movie does just that, and it works pretty great too. A solid movie experience that I wouldn't give enough stars to just throw off, but just see it in a lighthearted way, and that's where I wouldn't expect too much. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ First time writer-director James G. McAvoy's take on the story of a man who, after having done miserably in his job as a bank check fraud grand theft, has a terrible, life-altering, and life-changing drug high that causes him to lose all control of himself. The film has the look and feel of a home video, but the quality of film-making is not always the concern.<br /><br />While it's not perfect, the film maintains a realistic, sometimes beautiful, sometimes brutal, sometimes hilarious and sometimes gut wrenching realisation about life that it wants to leave you with while leaving you with a sense of total control that you never got from the film. Every scene is captured in, say, a rain forest so that everything is on a parallax with nature's beauty, that it becomes the viewer take all of everything in the film in a breath taking fashion. But, to me, the film also does a disservice to society when in some ways the film is almost a human 'wild ride' as opposed to having a very specific plot or setting. And this is what makes a film such as this so brilliant and fun to watch. If society demanded that films such as this should be made, than films such as this would be dismissed as a waste.<br /><br />And that's a problem I've always had with some of the reviews that I've read for this film, and of course, to the wonderful actors playing the characters, directors of which, if they honestly tried their best, could still only be described as sketchy and overly ambitious. And, as a writer, I'm always eager to see something new and exciting when a new creative project comes forward, but again, I've always felt that if a director has of heart and soul, the only thing that will ensure and sustain a quality film is a well written and executed script. That's just what the Irish director has proven himself and his film to be.<br /><br />So with all that being said. Let me just set the screen right where it needs to be for this film to do it's magic.<br /><br />This film is not only the home film of two of my most ardent fop fans, who have backed to date since the original release, it is also now sitting in my library, where I will continue to watch it whenever there's a new film that comes out. I recommend it to everyone with an eye for expression of real emotions, as well as a taste for the best films on the funniest channel and the most unique cinema experience of all. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I love this movie for many reasons, not the least of which may be it's originality. I actually watched all of the first two seasons on video, which incidentally led me to having my own collection of seasons over. Season 4 started out good with a pretty good cliff hanger and then became the complete opposite of everything I've seen since that initial season. That's all I need to say. I guess it's because all the actors weren't in the classic movies anymore. The show does run on a budget, but that doesn't make it any less than enjoyable, especially since you can tell most of the actors had pretty low budgets. What it does have is some of the greatest dialog, choreography, and sets I've ever seen in an action drama. It's the type of show where they have special effects but no one ever goes near having a costume made out of a piece of paper or plastic and then just needs to have the wardrobe people cut it down to a b-movie size.

      " the same age, she'll be all the wiser.<br /><br />As a film with an intriguing idea about a world being visited by \"watcher\", some nice visual effects are worth noting, and a small-scale, tightly-paced plot is kept interesting. However, the film suffers from the fact it couldn't really decide whether it wanted to be horror or drama, and settled for a meandering, confusing storyline. <br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"Bijou\" is a slice-of-life drama set within an old-time and small-town America. An older couple (of both sexes) lives in a quiet little town, with their little daughter in attendance. When the town has been vacant for several years, and the daughter's father is \"banned\" from next door, suddenly the couple has an idea of opening the old community to visitors. And there new resident is Julie (Mariane Vallee, in her best performance since \"Rosemary's Baby\") whom they introduce to them...<br /><br />\"Bijou\" is a very good film! There are quite a few good camera shots throughout, and there are some good script exchanges. I just wish the film makers had invested more development in the town of Tusadilla, where the film takes place. Instead, what we have here is a sleepy sleepy sleepy town that would have been better if the film had ended there. Overall, \"Bijou\" is a pleasant little film that is sure to ease your mind. Recommended! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is on my Top 10 list. Yes, I have to rate it as a movie, not because it's great or even good but because it has some good character interaction (and not just the \"hero\" kind), and it has some good direction (no slow motion or fast forward here). And it is a movie with a good amount of sex and nudity. As others mentioned, it's one of those movies that just settles in and stays there. It also has a lot of small elements that add something new (like the town being built around an old power plant), things that just expand the story without becoming monotonous. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ What a bad movie this one was. It seemed to have been made on a very low budget, but it doesn't really take a lot of talent to make a poor movie. Some of the acting was decent, but the movie's dialogue was completely unbelievable.<br /><br />The sound editing was so cheesy it was painful, at times I found myself yelling at the TV screen. The movie just seemed to drag on with random and bizarre scenes. For example, the chick who would usually be the star of the movie, randomly switched sides at the same time. The story also went nowhere for awhile, and after awhile I couldn't stand to see them. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a typical 80s film. Very predictable, as the title implies, with lots of gun fire and mayhem. I found that I was not buying into the main plot line - the guns get loose and a loser decides to use them to save a little girl. He kills the bad guy and saves the girl. Yuck! I wouldn't really like to have my 8 minutes back. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ \"Farewell to the King of Pop\" is not the worst movie to appear in the-Hallmark Channel yet. Of course, last year, the king was trying to steal the crown from the first one by showing commercials and making ridiculous videos. All the King's friends, except for a random girl who is like one of the most annoying, stupid and retarded youngsters that I have ever seen, are also called \"princesses.\" Their names are \"Puu-Puu-Puu.\" (You stupid, silly, no-two-thing-in-the-room kind of girl). All of the songs that are on this video are terrible and forgetable, which is why that Video has so little music. The production is very, very poor. In the first-fourth video, the making of the movie is far superior. Nevertheless, the king is not in this video that easily steals the crown that easily. Even a very low budget cannot save this Low Budget Video. I'll rate this Bad Video a 4 out of 10 _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I thought this had an interesting ending, but it was just wasted on me. There was no story that was even vaguely interesting (and not in a good way), the characters weren't developed at all, I was bored to tears, and the movie's ending was SO... SO bad. I just had to turn off the video to put on something else. I'll give it a two\n",

      ".<br /><br />A good family movie, without a plot or redeeming features. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ For those of you that have seen a certain other movie or series, or know a few of the people involved, you know that when A-list actors are involved with a movie there is always drama and there is some tension and there are actors who know their way around a camera (though this may not be a huge factor). There will be a lot of these extras in Nacho's movie (I have the VHS to prove it) so it's not like he is some sort of A-list actor. But he is just one of hundreds of extras. He is just part of a few of the actors in \"Nacho's Men\", an American movie that I have just seen.<br /><br />Anyway, Nacho was a good movie and some of the people involved seemed to be trying their best to finance the film. There are some similarities to a recent French film called \"Le Bilaneau\", as described by some tols in a recent interview with producer Geneve. I can easily understand from both films how they tried to make a French movie, a decent film and a funny one; Nacho offers some laughs in the French locale than he provides in this film. There are plenty of scenes to laugh at, so there will be a few laughs during the film. Some of the parts are even funny...the scene were the actress tells Nacho to take her back to his...hey Nacho grabs the arms of the production designer holding her head and pulls her backwards, the head of the actor spins upside down and slides up the back of the actress. There is a funny scene yet this movie is hilarious; but also there are a few funny moments like the scene where the actress has been shot in the stomach and Nacho grabs her for a quick moment by the neck, he pulls her around so she goes into the rear of the wardrobe (yawn)and Nacho grabs her again in front of him for a quick moment, they are dancing. The funny parts are just starting to come in Nacho's scenes... Nacho is a very funny guy who doesn't take himself seriously. He is one of my most favorite actors, he is always great in scenes that are serious and he is very funny, especially when he does comedy like in this film. Nacho has no problem acting in his own right, and he is going places with this project. I do not think that the film will ever be boring, and if you love to laugh, then definitely watch it, you'll be right there with Nacho. 9/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It is amazing that I saw this movie a total of 10 years after it was released in 1997. So many things have obviously changed along the line of thought, I'm not sure I can even put my finger on this one...'The Last Mile' is a classic. The idea of taking two legendary killers on a tour of the USA, on the bodies of people that they know they could kill, is a classic. And just imagine...this movie is a classic. It has some really great scenes! I have to watch it again to decipher it all!<br /><br />Well, the one thing you need to understand about this movie is that it has absolutely nothing to do with the \"New World Bank Presents...\" tour...at all. It is a classic in every sense of the word! You do not need to be a criminologist to see it...nor a movie buff to understand it!<br /><br />It is a good film- no, it is not a classic...but it is definitely worth a look...for fans of historical action movies, for all those who like thriller movies...and for fans of classic action movies. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a great sequel to Richard Pryor's iconic TV character Slim Pickens: He fights a couple of thieves at the end of the original film, and now Slim has been turned into Slim Pickens,a sexy young woman who likes nothing more than to thrash dudes. The movie mostly follows Slim,who was introduced in this film by her mother (Nancy Coleman), a popular television host. She and Slim start having their affair, and of course, Slim picks on petty patterboxer Johnny Carson,who is hired to be a moll to Slim's son. It's quite a good movie, full of great actors and performances. This film deserves to be a box office hit, and it got a solid nod from the MPAA. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie tonight and it was very good.

      " you in, please: If I could give it a zero I would have. The acting was ridiculous, the plot was not even funny, there was no suspense, the characters were extremely unrealistic (who would have thought). Don't waste your money on this one, there are worse movies out there. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ There seemed to be a different treatment of the game in this one, as if it had been remade into a \"CALL THIS RUSS!\" dance! The same situation occurred when I played the game on a computer. After a couple of game sets were repeated, I started out making a scene with 3 or 4 other players! It took about 50 minutes for all of the scenes to be displayed for all of the different models. There were maybe 3 of each character. It was truly awful, just like the other two, just as terrible. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I loved this flick. It starts out slow, but kicks into a good rhythm fast, and the climax (if you can call it that) is great! This should be a movie everyone is talking about. I'd recommend this to anyone with an interest in the 80's action movies because there's never been a better one. Do yourself a favor, and check this out and give it a try. This is a great movie! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Let's face it: it's always easy to make a movie that's great to watch on TV, but it's a damn shame that you often end up suffering from a crippling and fatal disease of television. So you can't just skip \"Laws of Attraction\" off the list you have to see it. This is the epitome of a so-bad-it's-good-to-watch series... the plot is so so so-so, the acting is decent, and it just depends on how much you can chew on. I think \"Laws of Attraction\" is a great example of a show that was given a real good hold by the NBC executives that allowed it to be cancelled because the network needed new shows. You can't go wrong either watching or waiting until the next \"Laws of Attraction\" or seeing this in theaters. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It is great to read these comments by people who clearly aren't afraid to write about Hollywood, or at least the people who made a career out of making movies that were made for other money, not realizing the true number of people in Hollywood who make movies with their lives on the line, are not easy. I have seen some pretty bad movies during my years in school that would make the people who made this movie look like \"sir\", not to mention the millions of people for whom music and dance was their main industry... but they don't know anything about life, the hustle and bustle of London. What they DO know, is why they DO go to the movies... and watch the movies.<br /><br />The people in this film are either unaware of how hard it is to act in the real world, or they have absolutely zero talent. When all 50 cents go to the producer's tab and they are left with over a thousand unrecognized, yet desperate words, then I don't think they are too far off the mark... they are too nice, for a change. I didn't enjoy, or even feel that any of the performances in this movie made us want to buy or rent \"A River Runs Through It\" for rent.<br /><br />I am not criticizing the writing and editing in this movie; they were good, and it was hard to believe that there were people whose names I might not recognize. What's hard to believe is that the writers did not think about that part. It's amazing that when a short is presented at the festival, the festival director will give it a standing ovation. Does that say anything about the audience who were there? Not that the audience liked it at all... it says something about the people who saw the movie.<br /><br />I think the best way for all of humanity to rise above the current system (and give these folks a chance), is for everyone to watch a real life, or two-hour movie together, so that we can all grow-up and just, hopefully, not be second-class citizens. It goes to show that we do need a more critical system.<br /><br />Thank you, Alex Apted, for letting us have fun. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie takes place after the attacks of September 11th in New York. It's a true story of a NYC Fireman (Raymond J. Barry), assigned to rescue two trapped terrorists.

Please stay away from it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ As some other posters have commented, \"The Big Lebowski\" is not a comedy, nor a horror, but it IS a historical document showing a failed experiment, and that there may have been other lepers in the thirties and forties who wandered the earth while others lived here (I doubt). Lebowski died when Pierre's sister Anne-Sophie was 12 years old, and the Lebowski home video has Anne-Sophie playing a deaf (and mute) girl in a secluded laboratory. She describes her hearing tests, and the listener follows in turn the struggle for the truth between Pierre and Lebowski. I saw the first part of this made-for-TV mini-series over twenty-four years ago; it was not clear to me then that it was a made-for-TV mess, but this new DVD version is a clear-cut release!<br /><br />The Lebowski, if nothing more than a cautionary tale of human rights violations carried out by a man whose great motivation for being a leper was his desire to free the world of Lebowski-like horrors from the clutches of the beast he created.<br /><br />The original 1941 deleted scenes, and subsequent re-editing, restore that original content, and allow the viewer to catch a glimpse of Anne-Sophie performing some of the leper tricks, while the filmmakers bring some restored footage up to date to fill in missing blanks. This is most satisfying viewing, because the rest of the film is equally or slightly interesting. I give it more than one star. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This was a pretty good effort, the only thing I'm really sad about is that not a lot of people saw it. I liked the music, and I found the performance of Vincent Price worth the price of admission. His voice and character feel very much 'right' after everything. In watching the film, I also thought that some of the scenes/concepts could have were a little more elegant and subtle. I didn't have the same feelings about a few of the minor characters, but as it ends up being fairly sad and sadder, so why not? I didn't care about any of the characters, except for a few 'in-jokes', but that's about it. It was a good story, and I wouldn't have ordered it otherwise. It's also one of the only film/musical offerings I've seen that wasn't completely mind-blowingly-deliberate. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am surprised that the IMDB voting scale doesn't currently go negative numbers. I'm going to start working towards a movie I feel ready to spend a pretty penny on. I hope I feel as safe buying this one as I did buying it.<br /><br />To those other IMDB voters: you don't believe anything I am about to say. If you do, I apologize. My wife did too. That's not fair. Don't even try to relate to it. You know? You've already made up your mind about it. Give me a break. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This series is one of the most important documentaries to come out of South Africa, and I thank all three creators of this great series for doing so. The production of TENDA, the documentary dealing with wildlife in Africa, was a collaboration among National Geographic, HBO and HBO from 1994-2005. And as someone else has posted here, I won't even bother to type them all into Google and won't let anyone else waste their time typing. All I wanted was to share this experience with a friend. Enjoyed both, though I do have to wonder about the accuracy of some of the camera work.<br /><br />It's sad that National Geographic chose not to air this in the UK. Perhaps in England they saw the numbers. In the US they were not seen as national heroes by the TV set. They were popular hosts. A \"laugh\" if I think about it.<br /><br />Some of the shots I liked. The ones dealing with sharks, for example. A girl in her swimming trunks, or as we would call them \"water trunks.\" A guy in rubber trunks walking around in Africa with the face and costume of some African wildlife, including elephant, lion and wildebeest.<br /><br />Another special note: The guy in a green safari-like outfit that is \"one of the most detailed\" - I don't know - but he is a John Deere (I presume from the product of Deere's Sealife products).\n",

      ". \"The Thing\" is an amazing movie. I give it an impressive 8 out of 10. I recommend it to all sci-fi fans. So many people I know and people who just like the sci-fi films don't like it. I know a few of the critics. But they don't give it enough credit. Give it a chance. The movie is incredibly fun to watch. There are absolutely no boring moments. It almost seems like a parody of blockbuster sci-fi films. That is what makes it so great. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A big disappointment of a movie. Too many mistakes at the start, then it gets worse by the minute. At least with Russian movies, you can see the first act badly written jokes in the last 20 minutes, even at this level. But here, almost every joke is done in the whole movie and some are even repeated several times. Also, the characters, such as the guy who discovers the first girl in a pub, just disappear. You have to wonder which are the two girls who just disappeared as a joke.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, there are only half naked girls in the whole movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ While watching this movie recently, I managed to see just how bad the sequel really is. About 2/3 of the way through, I started wondering why I should care. Because after I finished watching this crap I realized how absolutely unfunny it really is. There are only 2 characters: Jack Black and his posse, and Sue Price. The rest of the cast (my wife included) is a mix of varying intelligence, however none of them is good. As I was watching these people I would have guessed that they were some sort of racing team, or at least a group of bikers. They wear basically the same headwear in every movie and the movie. They're a bunch of drunks stumbling around bars and talking until they actually run over some biker's ribs while they're in the bar. Oh yeah, they're on a platform outside of a nightclub where they try to recruit a dancer/pupil for their party. After a few hours of constantly getting drunkered and being called ugly dumb for doing certain things for the other guys there never seems to be any sort of resolution. You have a bunch of guys who are supposed to be geeks (I'm one of them) and a bunch of guys who are supposed to be nerds. The one with the big tongue is often the one to talk, but if you actually listen to them, you can barely hear them. Usually at least one of them has some sort of super power or something, but often a combination of the two, or none.<br /><br />I can't think of any point to the original, other than maybe to hang out with my buddies and laugh hysterically at some stupid things they say/do while sitting around drinking. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ One of the best of the early talkie classic films. A good first movie for Petey Curry who appeared in numerous movies after this one. A very funny moment is when a bunch of people think he's dead when in fact he's alive and fighting them in a very low motion version of the old Indian sword fight (you have to see it to feel this). _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ After a year in exile, the surviving Nazis are on the mainland again. They have learned that underground there are groups of human and animal warriors called \"The Four Horsemen of Hell,\" and they are going to attack. Will They Win in the Fight for Justice of the Humanity and Equality of the Human Races?<br /><br />This is an underrated and obscure movie, but has great atmosphere. The story is told with great performances, the dialogs are thought-provoking and the direction is awesome. I enjoyed this movie, the atmosphere, and the fight sequences. This is one movie that I wish more people had heard of. For any fan of German movie or history, this is a must see.<br /><br />Highly recommended. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie had a lot of potential. The original 4 was at least entertaining and had a lot more to offer then a low budget 5. This one lacks that excitement.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie seems more like a short, because it only takes up about half an hour of movie time.<br /><br />The movie seems more like it should have been filmed on a lower budget. And I think that the music should have been a bit more up to par with the movie.<br /><br />The movie, as it was, wasn't all that bad, but it seemed to drag in parts.<br /><br />Overall, to find a good horror movie to watch, you really need good movie\n",

      " martion to be buried on the first day of the new year without his valet to guard it. An idiot rich girl (played by Rosie Alvarez, who has some sort of uncanny resemblance to Kim Basinger) takes over and wishes to be buried just like him. They don't know each other, but agree to be part of the new year celebration and to live the rest of their lives in the happy memory of their first night together.<br /><br />This is a stupid premise for a film, and it doesn't work even more stupid then when Don Bluth asked the producer to reprise his \"Mango Kiss\" (by calling it \"Mango Kiss 2\" as an apparent homage to Bluth's earlier film) and Alvarez plays the love interest for the impotent rich girl. This also doesn't make any sense. She's a thief, thief-keeper, or witch.<br /><br />But Alvarez has a couple of funny routines. One involves dropping her head in a crystal chandelier. Another involves being chased by an angry polar bear. The other is her hilarious portrayal of a car repairman in an Alistair Sim attempt to impress her rich boyfriend. She literally falls off the roof (after getting her arms around a pole, and the like) and the \"boring\" parts are simply awful. Her hair style is particularly ridiculous with constant use of bangs (her hair standing on end, while the poor girl is helplessly chained to the base). It's quite amusing from a purely mechanical, wooden performance when watching Alvarez as someone purely human (not to mention pretty), but it's a total washout in terms of the plot. She has very little to do or say during the film despite having a few scenes with other actresses.<br /><br />I think \"Kiss\" is a good example of a film that has not gained much merit since its release, and it is hard to think it ever would have had much merit. A much more worthy film to remember is \"Don't Let the Bears Go Bananas\". _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The movie is a masterpiece. If there was a movie worthy of having a sequel that closely resembles the original movie, this would be it. I highly recommend this movie for those who have seen it. I did not feel anything the second time around! It is a masterpiece of action, suspense, fighting, and great acting. If you don't have it, rent Don Rides' excellent first movie and don't believe everything you see and hear. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I can't believe I actually sat down with some friends to watch this mess. And then we decided to not go for the obvious reasons, like: a) the writing is atrocious b) some of the action scenes are hilariously ridiculous, or c) the casting is truly pathetic and d) the overall quality is appalling. After just a few moments that supposedly takes place in a small, beautiful city, we didn't even think it could actually happen. The special effects are laughable, and the acting at best is laughable. I've watched a few episodes of Corridors of Time on the Laserdisc, and I know they're good; the plot has them all too near the top, except one. And this one has it all too near the top. It's so far the worst thing I've seen on TV so far. And my boyfriend can't even describe it. At one point, one of the characters must have jumped off of a roof and landed on her head. UETTTTTTTTTTTT. The writing is so bad that I don't think it could be a made-for-television movie, much less put into production. The acting is horrible in places, and the camera shots are laughable. It feels more like a movie from the early '90s. The make up effects are laughable. They really need to put up with this stuff.<br /><br />So, to sum it up: don't waste your money on this thing. Don't even bother renting it. It's not worth even a dollar. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I was very much looking forward to catching this film, having read one of the other reviews and seen the first preview. However, I was a blissfully unaware of what to expect when I started watching it. When in doubt, leave it in. I even checked to make sure that the DVD version played without commercials. But that aside, I really didn't find this movie a bad idea. It certainly doesn't drag at all, and as a devoted viewer of the genre I am very pleased with this film, and very much enjoy the performance of Chris Kattan, who plays \"Moose\". There are many good things to say about this film, including some of the most excellent cinematography and the overall script. I do not consider this film very original, but there is\n",

      " Nordman has to do a better job next time I see the old man. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I don't know much about the real story behind \"Dressed to Kill\", but this movie seems to give a very basic sense by which the film is about to come out. The movie offers many opportunities for gore and nudity, so it's definitely worth checking it out. The story follows a young man, Dillon (Craig Sheffer), who lives with the director of a camp company, Danny Tamblyn (Jeff Fahey), until they both get jobs at a cremation parlor. One day, the deceased user of the company's service is lured back to the living by a hit man, Tony (James Lesure), who is actually a member of the company payroll. Dillon agrees to take the job, and at the same time, Tony's dead mother (Jean Peters) returns to the living to visit her, and after the deceased user dies, he takes the job over for the head guy (Brian White), and after some more corpses are taken, the real hit man is hired and a sadistic funeral is held. Dressing to Kill does a nice job of focusing the movie on the real story, and, in many ways, it better than the average fare of that horror/comedy. There are some funny parts buried under the many burlesquests in the making, such as the scene where the dead user talks to the corpse at the beginning of the movie, and the character's name is Wallace, and he tells Dillon the first command he is about to die.<br /><br />\"Dressed to Kill\" is a good film to watch for a zombie flick, but if you're looking for an original horror/comedy that's a bit more subtle, and has good pacing, \"Dressed to Kill\" is a good choice over you've got it. Rating, 4.5/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie a while ago... I thought it was a wonderful movie and I laughed myself silly a few times, such as the scene where the two thieves are breaking in by just pretending to be dead people. Another thing is the director showed all of the scenes and color digitally, and they are very good. I saw a part of the editing and it was awful and it totally ruined the whole look and feel of the movie.<br /><br />However, the main theme is important and I found it important to make this movie. In South America, they have the street-fighting and other things that are done by the low-class, but on the same street, people are almost civilized. On the other hand, the high-class live down to being poor and dirty, and are the only kind of people who make this sort of lifestyle.<br /><br />I found it interesting that in the beginning of the movie, one of the police officer named Antonio (Luis Luque) says that he is going to shoot a young child if this kid won't do something that is his way of work, which makes me think that he has a personal issue with what goes on at the school, as he doesn't seem to have a home and a place to go. And there seems to be a pattern to the kids who are leaving school and get the feeling that they had to leave the school or to have to work outside.<br /><br />All in all, it is an excellent fun movie and I recommend it for anyone who wants to see a movie with this theme and more.<br /><br />8/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ First off, I don't recall a lot about the writing for this show, but it just left me very depressed. It also created an enormous divide in my gender group, and children will see this as a terrible show, and I'll probably never understand why. The main character, Spanky (voiced by the wonderful Delenn Kincaid) has not any backbone whatsoever, and is not trusted by anyone, in this continuity nightmare. Also, a rather prominent character, Fuzzy Bird (voiced by Jamie Little) is absent for a large portion of the episodes - although this may be because of limitations placed on Fuzzy Bird's range by the writers.<br /><br />The only positive I can think of for this mess is the cast - everyone involved should be embarrassed it took itself so seriously. If you see this show on video, skip the episode entirely and watch \"Shazam\"!<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ In the first 10 minutes I saw this film I was bored out of the wits. Nothing added and nothing taken from the original H.G. Wells tale. I could go on forever with the topic of how this story is inaccurate. It is the job of remake and DVD companies to market their own version\n",

      "URE. It takes a good while to get going, but when it gets going, it's a blast! <br /><br />Great soundtrack. Can't wait for it's upcoming DVD release! <br /><br />This movie rocks!!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A movie which could well be described as cheesy, but you have to give it an intelligent taste.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the old West movies and was intrigued by the fact that Joe Estevez (director) had directed a few such westerns in his career as well as this one.<br /><br />The movie is about a lawman (Estevez) and his partner who get mixed up with a trio of notorious outlaws. Unfortunately for them, their partners are some of the meanest, hard drinking, gambler with no sense of decency and a lot of petty stealing.<br /><br />An ambush is called and everyone breaks out except for the two partners. And as the wild night winds down, they stick their tongues in the windmill of reality and live out the rest of their miserable lives. <br /><br />I was pretty impressed by both movies but as I watched the third one on while eating an oatmeal, I was wondering why Joe wasn't in it much better. Maybe his life was more interesting than me.<br /><br />I thought the movie got done in a way that was hard to swallow. The script had so many cracks that it needed to be broken up into two or three mini-slashes.<br /><br />It took awhile to get the \"stolen camera\" theme to work. But the result is worth it. The acting is excellent and the entire movie works.<br /><br />What I am trying to say is that you shouldn't miss this one, but if you do, you will be disappointed. Just give it a chance because you could still very well prefer the old West movies. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Wow, what a movie! I've only seen about a half dozen in my life; this is the best of them all! <br /><br />It's simply hilarious, and touching as well. It deals with an actual fact, accurately. And a range of emotions, that are almost too few for most people to experience. Even though I can only comment on one side of the movie for the most part, as a movie watcher... it still made me laugh; especially towards the end when the girl was actually having sexual doubts about going to a real boy's party.<br /><br />This movie is absolutely amazing; watch it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ <br /><br />After the first viewing of this movie, I never heard anything about it. But this morning I got it from Netflix by 1:37 am. I never checked the link again because about 3 hours later I saw \"American Movie\" and \"Gone With the Wind\". As soon as I heard about this, I panicked and registered at IMDb just because of this movie. I'm glad to say that I didn't watch it...<br /><br />I am a movie critic and have seen hundreds of movies, but that's pretty low on my list; however, this movie brought it to another level of crappy movie. What's not to like? The music was good; the acting, not so-great. For instance, the kid who was \"riding\" the horse through the mud and trying to climb down some holes while its hind legs were \"baked\" was one of the better acting parts, but even the actor who played the part of the \"good-cop\" was a mixed bag. That the \"bad\" cop was better than the average citizen was right of the bad acting!<br /><br />There was really nothing interesting or special about that \"bad cop\". But after all, \"good cop\" is the highest rated title in my database, so I guess you can see what this movie was actually about. I actually liked it, if only for its ending.<br /><br />Definitely not worth watching. Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen! The actors all looked bad and the movie was quite poorly shot. The sound track of the movie was horrible. I've heard that it was set against the background of nature. I would hope so, but even the environment can't keep this movie alive for two hours. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Well this review contains a spoiler. I rented this movie because I heard it is a classic and I figured this would be about the same. Boy was I wrong (pun intended). Here is a great movie to start the day with if you have nothing to do. If you watch this movie for whatever reason then you just might like it. So I give it a thumbs down.\n",

      " break that I don't care to go into the details of.<br /><br />The acting itself was pretty lame, the women were mostly a mess, and the men were pretty ugly & ugly, but the most irritating were the little kids.<br /><br />However, it was hard to believe a guy like that ever thought he'd get away with what he did, and I'm glad he was captured. I watched it twice on Univ.net this week, and it took forever to just pay attention to it, considering how slow the other versions are.<br /><br />I can't say I was shocked, as this type of movie is just as predictable as any other, but the director made a point of using a light sabre-like device to try with each camera angle, and it worked beautifully. But I didn't really like the lighting scheme of some of the scenes, and it made me want to kill him and smash his head into the wall.<br /><br />I also hated all the guys who kept doing hand motions, even though they were doing it for the most important part of the film. It was sickening.<br /><br />Overall, though, this was just a bad film. If the director wanted a serious movie with a real plot, it would have been the Conan-level gory serial, but I think that when a director does the same thing over and over again and just changes the camera angle and just keeps running the same ways, then you have a better movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have to say that I really disliked this movie, but I don't write down how I feel. I have to say that I am not a sports fan as such but I did enjoy this movie a lot. Yes, it's a spoof but I felt that it is a very enjoyable spoof and in my opinion, works pretty well. It's not the best, of course, but the whole atmosphere of the movie is set that it will work and is not a sports movie. I am glad to see a guy from Brazil coming into the movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ An absolute piece of fluff on the part of the lead female in this film. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. None of the story is explained here, which tells you something to that, makes me wonder how they even bothered making this. What is even more, at this moment in time we are in the middle of one of those weird political transition periods that we get to witness movies like this one to come out of. In other words, I don't even know what I was on this side of the fence, sorry to all for my disinterest.<br /><br />3/10. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is about on time I watched it. I got it from my mom & dad (writers at the shop with Mr Scott) so I was looking forward to it and was a bit nervous at the back of the theatre when I watched it. The entire audience gave all good remarks, they gave it a fair shake, & every one was as funny as the next, it will appeal to anybody. It isn't \"The Simpsons\" to this film so if its nothing to watch but the shorts they put out. The script is hilarious, the film is not boring & it is very enjoyable even with it all. I just wish a version had been given to the filmmakers when they made it, to get it finished and released. We all think they are going to make a sequel in the future but I am so happy & looking forward to a possible future version. The kids (all five of them) are cute, well behaved & can't act & are really all smiles at the top of their game. We just wish they had done a little more work to be in the film, because that is the only way they could have been. We also love the songs - it was hard to break up with them as some of them are quite difficult to sing (especially \"just a child in a daze\"), I couldn't dance with them, and that was quite a feat for many kids. All in all, I have absolutely enjoyed it so many times over the last few years, I am not going to give too much away, it is a really well written & done film & I for one would recommend it to anybody. I did see it again for a second during its recent San Francisco premiere and it is absolutely incredible - the script is flawless but in what way is that to be revealed. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A well written and played over the top drama about a family that has to deal with death of a child.

      " in it and that's something else that makes it special. The plot is predictable the first three minutes, but the plot keeps building up and then throwing it down a mountain. It's a great movie. The special effects are spectacular, the scenery is incredible and the performances were outstanding. This is an amazing adventure film that could make you say \"Wow, it really is amazing\" all over again. All actors fit in perfectly and you can't really tell apart from the characters. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This was the type of movie where you expected to see a lot of guts and lots of blood, but you didn't ever really expect to see a lot of humor. The humor isn't always humorous. For example in the first half of the movie, the house gets taken over by zombies. And they don't always seem to eat the dead. So the next scene would be a bit different, because then none of the zombies would eat the dead people. This just sort of annoyed me a lot. I would also like to say that I liked the scene where the zombie had his tongue in his cheek, and then the zombie just stood up and bit the guy in the nose. But the rest of the movie had a lot of humor, but it wasn't a very funny film. I give it a 7/10, because it wasn't boring, it just kind of annoyed me a little. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If you're looking for someone to argue with while watching this film, you could do a lot worse. Here is a film that tries to be different, with a group of very talented actors arguing about the script. This is something that most actors would do. Well, not quite all, of them. It's very uneven. At one moment the voice of the main character is spoken by an actor who is very talented, and so he wants to be brought up to their level of fame. Then, there's a scene where an audition tape shows everyone in the cinema; and the narrator says, \"These are the people who will be the stars of next year's Ozfest.\" And you realize half of the actors on this tape are barely famous, and they would've had better roles. There were several other instances where the voice of the main character faded out of anyone's head. On the other hand, the actors were all very pretty and interesting. As a big movie theatre production it is not very well done at all. The plot is also very dull, the characters are not fully developed at all. If the film needed to give some more about the story to the audience, it might have tried to put it in a movie about the journey of an old man in the desert, and why he gets to tell a lot about the journey of an old woman who is going back to her original home at the end of the film. But that might not have made the movie much better. It was like watching a train wreck. When the director finally let's the film run, I kind of was shocked. Not that the movie needed a great deal of gore and sexual details because, well, there was plenty of that, even in the trailer. It almost made it sick to my stomach. I think that with any movie of this kind, you should at least enjoy it to the end. A lot of the people in the cinema walked out pretty quickly. They expected a good bit of gore and were pleasantly surprised. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ After a fun night at the movies a little while back, my husband and I decided to take a look at the new season of the old classic sitcom. We discovered that the show's creators, both the writer and the director, were the most irresponsible person around. The show's scripts and director were so far from scriptwriting and had instead replaced that art with a series of badly scripted interstitial segments showing scenes from the main characters' past that made no sense at all. The show's scripts could have been written by ten-year-olds. The characters' stories were absurd and unconvincing. It was clear that this only was a new show for the boys to show behind their favorite new brand of comedy. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The movie has no narrative, no structure, no structure in itself. Its title tells you to forget any knowledge of the real life situation, including the suffering of the mother while her child is at stake. Even if you were to see the movie in any depth, its effect will be to make you want to kill your TV or VHS player, at the slightest provocation. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Let's be honest; the first time I watched a show so bad it was a letdown was that horrible \"The 100 Greatest American TV Shows That Never Made It\" show from 2002.

      ". The \"twist\" is in, and out, right at the start to the finish, which is a stroke of genius. The acting is brilliant, and, like on another thread, the story is wonderful. The final twist, in my opinion, is one of the best twists in years. There is more to it than just the ending. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ What is so bad about this film is that it has so many potential to be a laugh a minute long film. If we could give it the same treatment to the original, Manos the Hands of Fate would have made it a successful cult movie. However, to take some of the same ideas and stages from the original and re-make it and film it on the big screen at least makes some sort of sense.<br /><br />Let's start with the opening scenes. These are some people running about in packs or through the jungle. Oh, the start of a jungle documentary! What follows is a kind of film in the jungle. The first thing I thought was bad was the lighting. The second thing I thought was bad was that the jungle was so foggy, it looked like a sitcom show. The Third thing I think was bad was that we are watching a woman, who is totally wild with her fists, but yet so tame and under the surface that everyone becomes bored and comes to prefer other people who are not so wild and stupid.<br /><br />The final thing I thought was just weird was that despite all of the nudity, there was no real erotic scene filmed where either man or woman should come out. I mean, it's not the sex or the nudity I love either, but it is the completely bizarre and pointless sex that the horror part was filmed in.<br /><br />What I mean by that, is that if you are going to see this film, don't go into this movie expecting any sort of erotic effect or the idea of a horror documentary. Go into this movie expecting one scene of nudity every two or three minutes instead of about 20 scenes of nude males/women. And by the way, does anyone know how many of those people actually got killed in the jungle? I mean, I can't say it was a horror movie and it was not so bad because of the nudity, but I do think I wasted my time watching it.<br /><br />To sum it up, a bad horror movie and a bad film with nudity. I'm just making that paragraph read better. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is an excellent series about a man (Kelsey Grammer) who's been turned into an all-powerful telepathic telepathic killer. He falls in love with Nicole Kidman, but it makes things difficult because Kidman is such a ruthless woman. Also, I'm glad they got rid of all the annoying characters that were annoying in the first movies. Overall, although this movie is kinda sad, you can't ignore this movie, especially if you're into thrillers. It's a very good action movie.<br /><br />7/10<br /><br />Rated R for violence and language. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I will admit - this was the first of the series - and although I have not seen any after rebroadcasts, I certainly wish I did. It has the same basic feel as the first series, but is obviously much less polished. (I only watched the first series on my tape and plan to buy the full set on DVD) The fights were so painfully long - at least the fighting in this movie lasted just as long as the entire previous movies! I wish I remember one fight in particular - in which a pair of dumb teenagers try to knock each other out using a rake. One of them manages to hit one of the fighters and slashes her to the floor - but the other one is gone. What can I say other than her one short comment - why the hell was she there at all?. All in all however, I was thoroughly impressed with the storyline and the combination of cool fighting sequences and awesome scenery. Unfortunately the story was probably the weak part of this movie.<br /><br />There was a lot of dialogue throughout the movie, which was annoying - especially when there was no dialog in the fight scenes. The dialog was so lame - almost like you were listening to a bunch of kids talking about a fight they witnessed in the woods.<br /><br />And I wish I could find one good thing to say about this movie - the soundtrack was absolutely awesome. From the sounds of the fights - the atmospheric soundtrack - it sounded like a shoot out (with guns) between two packs of psycho killers! What I mean is - in one scene the soundtrack swelled to a major accompaniment - and then it abruptly stopped. In another scene, if I looked too closely at the character on his head for my liking - I was\n",

      " girls.<br /><br />This is just one bad movie. The special effects are horrendous, the acting even worse. This has got to be the worst directed movie ever made that I saw. Nothing about this movie has any value other than making a bunch of money off of people. There is nothing worth watching here.<br /><br />I don't understand how that can be considered a horror movie. The acting is as bad as the actors. The movie is just bad in every way. The only reason I found this movie to be so awful is because it is directed by one who had the actual pleasure of making it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw this movie with the idea of \"how will the main character live after being in a mental institute\". This is how, through the very first 10 minutes of the movie this movie has given me the initial idea of what is to become after i watch the movie!!!<br /><br />I was hooked through the entire movie and not rested in the beginning. There are some shocking scenes and some slow moving but emotional scenes too.<br /><br />I would advice anyone who are interested to watch this movie to go and see the movie or even write something in the script because afterwards i would write a comment about it! i would also advise people to watch the movie after finishing it and not listen to the previous comment because the next article i will write will not include the information that will be inside the movie!<br /><br />Good Job to the Director/Writer/Producer. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In order to evaluate this film you should consider its context. First, it is about the battle at Ornovitz. The most remembered events are the bombing of Ornovitz, the evacuation of train passengers and the air raids. Second, it is a film about the air raids and not only about the Ornovitz battles but about the war as well. Third, the film isn't a straight war film - it is about a conspiracy of world powers. It is like watching a true film about the fall of the Western Democracies in the USSR. This film is more realistic about the powers vs. powers in a world power fight. Fourth, the film isn't about politics but about a powerful desire for power and that there should be a world power (perhaps at all levels) war. Finally, it is about how power interacts. It takes place in different worlds, in different epochs in history. All of these points make this film important. It is certainly NOT a conventional film about power and politics!<br /><br />This film is just an ordinary film with an agenda: it wants to be a more realistic version of the power struggle that took place during WW II. But it isn't. The power (politics) is the main plot...but it is overshadowed by the question \"Who will win the war?\" The film is too biased against people, by today's technologies with a TV as the main-stream media and its propaganda as the \"winning media\".<br /><br />There is no plot, it's just a normal war movie with a few characters that do ordinary jobs (lots of people die as a result of this) and in such a way, it is a soap-opera.<br /><br />It looks like: war like any other non-military movie, without any special effects, but with real people, acting and directing. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is a good film for a rainy day or a movie night with the kids. A real treat for them is as the father dies in the first half of the film, thus beginning the family disintegration story line. This film is mostly geared to a male audience seeking fathers that may have been lost or at least not recognized by today's film producers. The film shows many men that look, acting, and talk the same way as all of the others in the film? (Which I presume is funny, given the way men talk and act in films.) I know what you are going to do if you like watching movies; rent this, watch it a second time, repeat it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ My mistake for thinking this film was a serious movie because there were no saurims to compare it with and even the name \"Saukat\" makes you think you are going to see some funny \"80's\"-like horror flick. <br /><br />Well, you're not so. The first 15 or so minutes of the movie are okay without any saurims, but then after that, the movie starts introducing CGI, lame excuses for 'superior' flying machines or whatever they call them. <br /><br />The plot is really lame: some scientist keeps his wife in a coma when one of the creatures eat her face off and send her into another dimension where they have\n",

That is always a laugh, I laughed SO much at the acting in this movie (I remember them playing 'duet reciting' in the office as one expression during a re-read, and I laughed PERMITTINGLY at those scenes..)<br /><br />Well, if the plot sounds amazing, believe me, you wont forget it, the 'twists' just roll with each little twist at the end, and that 'twist' is so wonderfully detailed that it was both clever and amusing.. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ With an interesting title like \"The Tingler\", I did not expected much from this film. However, after unboxing it, I was disappointed. It was bloody dull, there was no plot, and the ending was very unsatisfying. It seemed as if the writers tried to fit in last year's Oscar season; a lot of the jokes fall flat, much like \"Jesus is Magic\". Also, all of these writers are white men! I was also waiting to hear about this coming soon to Netflix. What a joke! IMO, I would have to rate \"The Tingler\" as a \"1\" out of 10. It sounded like a fun night! The only positives I noted where the acting and comedy. They were pretty good, but nothing special. On the positive aspects, Eddie Izzard provides much laughter, as well as some more tension. I don't think the writers were trying to make this movie. And a few of the references in the ending (like the reference to the \"King of Queens\" in the last scene) were too obvious. Overall, this film was disappointing. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I think that this is quite a good film that is funny and touching. It shows in the most perfect way how people can die in 24p situation. the way the family get together to deal with this illness is beautifully done. Everyone has his/her own problem with the \"impossible\" to keep one's self alive. you will be rooting for these people and will find yourself in the situation that they are in. Be sure not to miss it! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ One would think that with a name like Gary Larson as in 'Gremlins', it would give the creators of this movie some sort of expectations. Sadly what we get is a film that starts out as the premise for a movie about a 'Gremlins' like the little dino like 'Gremlins', who are then given a real life adventure to 'Gremlins' like the. However, instead starting out as an excuse for some lame slapstick, the movie becomes anything but pretty as the movie spends far too much time on how these four little creatures attack, joke about murder and get into all kinds of trouble (even giving a little bit a helping hand at the end!). I didn't really see how any of these scenes fit into the movie, especially since there are so many more scenes like 'Killer Tongue' with this one, and so many more in between. While watching this movie I felt that it was either missing out on some laughs, or it was having the same old boring script and writing. Do not mistake these two things as the same as the few laughs in 'Gremlins' as that has no way around this.)<br /><br />'Gremlins' is best seen on the big screen since it is the only way to see this film, or since you are already pasted in to your DVD. If you buy this one, make sure you don't leave by in the middle because you'll regret it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I've always been of one of the opinion that the more a film is about the people living around the city the more a film should be about the people inside, or more about the environment. If such a film is going to be about anything, it should be at least a biographical one. I can see that this film is going to be in fans faces, but I do wish they did a better job of it. If so, well done. What I liked most about this film was the story of the life between two guys who didn't give much of an interest to others outside of their hockey buddies. They were very real and some of it was refreshing, though for this story I can see the makers tried too hard to make it more than it was. However, because of poor dialogue and some serious wardrobe and hair choices the performances in this film are lacking. I felt like this effort was trying shoehorn several of them together to get a more complete story. I saw one moment and I wish I had stopped there. Maybe next time when they are trying to find the subject. I would love for the story to be more about the people living around the\n",

      " was a great film - one of my favorites, and very touching - that I hope would someday come into vogue. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I have a vague memory of the original being a film with a strong message centered around the effects of war on a particular community. I believe the producers cut this version because they were unhappy with the way it turned out. What is left is a confusing mish-mash of flashbacks, old film clips and snippets from the movie itself that are not meant to be fully understood (nor are they really). The movie is a muddle with many scenes that are not cut together, many scenes overlapped and overlapping, scenes dragged throughout, no cohesive story. The director chose to make it quite vague and confusing to the point where the audience and narrator feel they are jumping into the story without being told the entire story properly. This creates a confusing film that loses much of its impact and meaning when compared to the original film.<br /><br />The main character who is initially \"bad\" (and has a BRILLIANT English accent) turns out to be, in actual fact, quite good (and believable as an English student, no less!). His long suffering and hopeless relationship was brutally exposed in this final season. The cinematography and art direction was far better than the original, which was shot in a very low budget and on hand made (not hand made!) film. The acting was far better too. However, the acting by the two leading actors was not nearly as good as the actor that played Dwight. The leading actor was more wooden (no pun intended) and seemed miscast and overly over handled. The scenes bordering on over-the-top made-for-TV comedy were cliched and silly, especially with the recent AIDS scare, and many of the lines were simply flat.<br /><br />Overall, this was pretty bad stuff. It's nowhere near the original (or even the truly good) and it didn't really seem like this was the producers only attempt to make a serious picture (although one can argue they DID succeed for a while). The overall tone and vibe of the movie is bad, and it seemed as if the producers tried too hard. But, if you want to see something genuinely different and try to understand a better definition of what it is they did of Okinawa, then watch the Okinawa monologues. This is not the film you want to see with a serious heart attack.<br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br />Code Red DVD Extras: 6 minute film treatment of \"Pentagram\" <br /><br />The Bottom Line:<br /><br />I am a fan of 70's films and have read that book now for the umpteenth time. The book is good. And I have read every season 2 volume, twice if that, and all the prequel volumes. So you better do that IMDb's language filter, ok? The film only has a VERY small amount of content. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The first film was not great. I thought it would be a throw-back to a certain style of humour that had all been pushed aside and done a lot more now. This is not so. It's one of the finest comedy films I have seen; it's the best comedy I will ever see. Not to spoil, but I will spoil it. I don't think there is anything at all wrong with this film, and that in fact it is one of the most humorous films I've seen. It is funny. It may seem a bit melodramatic, but it is. There was never a greater feeling of humour in this. It does not aim to please people, but it even makes people smile. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I have never understood this movie. What does it have? Nothing good. The beginning is too slow and is almost entirely pointless. The plot is absolutely predictable, as is its conclusion (hopelessly missed, since it happens so fast and in such a bad way to begin with, that I could watch forever just to see it end -- there is no closure or style to this film!) As for the acting, while some aren't awful (the lead lady is especially good) it's a bit stil very, and it is very unpleasant to watch as the main character who has to convince everyone to join his club, and also convince the girls he wants to go to school with. However, the real problem with this film, is the quality of the photography -- everything looks so cheap and amateurish that it is almost laughable, even when the main character is in a club, and even more pathetic when the club's members go home and watch him get coffee with some of the other guys! Also, not caring what you do in an open club -- you shouldn't sneak up on anyone! -- is so much for the story.\n",

      ". The plot itself is well handled, the acting is fine and there are some laughs as well - most with Mr. Belushi! The main problem I have with the movie is its ending - I expected a little more from it than what was delivered! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"This is America and this is horror,\" proclaims the blaringly on-screen narrator at one point during a long flashback to the beginning of the film. With these words ringing more than ever and the camera-work that is undeniably creepy, but ultimately tame in comparison to the equally unnerving flashback sequences, Scream focuses on several disparate characters whose quiet existence at the small screen poses a killer in their own right. These are a young man named Jeff (Richard Roundtree), his wife Sue (Ava Gardner), Nate (Edward Ermey), Sara (Judy Rios), their teenage daughter Nicole (Brittany Flowers) and a mentally unbalanced young lady, Mary (Alyson Haywood), all join Jeff and his unstable and increasingly violent girlfriend Tracy (Lynn Collins), who as a mean-spirited teenager also killed the family dog, Alexander (Ben Yee), a human-be-all, in a fit of anger and frustration, respectively, following a family tragedy. Scream takes many of these archetypes by the throat and throat shtick and adds a fourth character that is also deadly to his own, the mentally unstable male hitch-hiker (Burt Reynolds, flicking the character's picture on and off the spine-chilling scream), the psychotic ex-cowboy (Michael Berryman), his family's leathery brother and Sue's snotty little sister. Scream continues on with these threads and then plunges deeply into the mind and heart of the killer and his story of stalking back into the past, a small spark which, thankfully, is quickly extinguished.<br /><br />The two-dimensional characters that haunt you don't always reveal themselves in the story, but they do invariably speak into the dialogue and often provide some interesting plot points in this sharp study of a seemingly disturbed young man who continues on in the same thread of events, looking for the one thing. One such is the brother's long digressive ramblings that, however unintentionally hilarious, are at the forefront of everything that follows and are, ultimately, the film's only real surprise. Scream is a film that tries to be shocking, but ultimately misses the mark and disappoints, but in a way that is very satisfying.<br /><br />There is also a great underlying tone, which runs throughout, making the film far less linear than its predecessors. A killer's rampage is much more exciting and gory in this film than in Scream. This is because it is the focus of the movie, rather than the victim, and we all know something awful is going to happen, so the final shock that comes out of the killer's actions is a more interesting and gory climax than the original killer's. Also, the acting is excellent, particularly the teen character Sue, and the other characters and antagonists are also well handled and well-defined. <br /><br />The music is excellent, not too clunky and memorable, but also not obtrusively fun like the original soundtrack. The score for Scream is a more popular song set to a moving image than the original, but then comes in later as well to add atmosphere and to demand more screen time. I have to say as much in favour of the soundtrack, I felt like it became more important the moment the killer was on the screen rather than the story itself. It all comes to a near perfect climax for the killer which gives the film another focus in the mind.<br /><br />The score is very much a victim, stripped and stylistically important, but still excellent and memorable and excellent.<br /><br />This is a great film and doesn't get any more special after the initial 80 minutes. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If a movie goes off the scale or becomes a parody of itself, and doesn't have a clue about what it is supposed to be doing, it ceases to be a movie, and takes on a life of its own. Crazed Housewives has the misfortune of becoming an after movie of sorts, and is now the property of fans like me who like movies that go off the scale but aren't really bothered by the movie itself. The movie had the chance to be serious, clever, intelligent and entertaining....it wasn't. I kept waiting for a character from the movie to speak to some important plot point about life... it never happened. Instead, we ended up with a dumb movie full of meaningless people acting badly in ways that did nothing but distract from the stupid, pointless story. And, in an effort to not make the title of the movie ridiculous, even if the premise is stupid, the movie is given a couple of very big, meaningless death scenes. And, again\n",

      " With this movie I am beginning to think of the great ones. Let's start with the best: the plot. It's one I've heard a lot in the last years, and indeed in some big productions. It's very complicated and involving, and it makes you want to watch longer and longer. Then the fight scenes, great as they are, are also very professional. The camera-work sometimes looks a little bit fake, but this is very easily compensated by the very professional sound. The acting is also very good, I've seen much worse, and there are some very good actors in the film. The script makes a perfect complement the great action, and you don't see much of anything, because there's so much happening all at once. In any case, you need to see this film. All the actors are worthy to be recognized. The director does a very good job of introducing the main characters, and is also keeping a perfect balance. There really aren't too many mistakes in the film. If you've already seen it, watch it, otherwise don't. If you liked this movie, you should definitely see the new one, coming out in the second quarter of 2000. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I had no expectations when I saw the movie, which I am now officially PREM FORVINED to view and be disappointed with. Why? Because, for one, it's Mika Waltari's first movie and his first 2 aren't NEARING as good as any of his best. (I can't believe I didn't realize this until I saw his profile and mention it) But this movie, while not his best is the only movie he has made since SHIFTS of GLADIATOR (1987) and SHIFTS OF GLADIATOR 2: THE FASTER YEARS (1989).<br /><br />I have read the 'blanchettes' and was never impressed, mainly because the plot line is pretty threadbare. Though there is some HSI shooting (the final shot is actually a bit of gore), very little else occurs. <br /><br />There are actually 3 short stories in the movie, and the third one concerns two high school girls and a body builder. The stories are pretty good but it's really the editing that really lets the quality down. <br /><br />This movie was one of my reasons to get the DVR. You don't get much, if any, of Shifters (or any of the other characters) without a good bit of work from a 'professional' journalist. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I first made a tape of this show in college in the early 70s. I saw it on a UPN affiliate in Los Angeles, and watched it for about a year.<br /><br />It was a rare, nostalgic gem for me. It's a \"feel-goody\" sitcom, and I have to admit, I would watch anything in that format now.<br /><br />It began with a nice opening title song, and I imagined that this would be a great family sitcom. It was not to be. The plots were all too silly and far-fetched, not nearly as fun as watching anything like \"Family Guy\" with Tim Matheson. The entire first season could've been condensed into less than an hour, and the humor was not nearly as sharp.<br /><br />It was like the cast from a Mattpsons episode, with Bill Hunter replaced at the end. I imagine the episodes were filmed in different parts, and the songs were different songs, as well, I suppose each episode could've been made up of 2-3 different episodes --- I don't see how that's possible.<br /><br />As far as watching a show with a comedic plot, there isn't much to get excited about. There are a few chuckles, and about a half hour or so at a time, but really, it's not very funny.<br /><br />For me, even though the sitcom does have its moments, the show fell flat. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The premise of this film sounds like it could be a genuine passion project, but the result is a boring film with a love story that takes place on a small island. From start to finish, the director just leaves the movie dead. The story of this movie, and the reasons for the situation, are pretty much unknown to the audience (to my knowledge). The result is a boring film with no point, unless of course you feel that sex and violence is a waste of time, only for voyeuristic purposes. A very boring film. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Okay, folks, let's give the guy a break!

I didn't understand at all how John got from the hospital to the road that night. Also, when she left her car like she was so sorry she had met her death. The ending was so hokey and the story so unbelievable. The characters were stereotypical and I was so scared and scared until the credits rolled. Don't waste your time go see this movie, you'll want to kill yourself after a while. Save yourself 2.5 hours of your life. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is one of the rare films to be made about the world of kung fu, and boy was it a success! This movie is a must for all people into kung fu movies and also anyone interested in Chinese historical kung fu films. It is a must-see especially for people of kung fu/martial arts and historical dramas especially because the acting is good, the soundtrack is good and the costumes and special effects are great. The special effects of course are excellent and also include the wirework and the fly on the wall tombs. Anyone interested in Chinese historical kung fu film or especially if they are into kung fu/martial arts and would like to see this movie, then this is a good film to see. It is not very historical and shows a lot of beautiful old movies as well as much better and many new movies coming out today as well. If you have never seen Chinese historical films you would have no idea what this is and what people in China have been watching today.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ What an awful movie. The music and the story lines were great, very interesting and well done, but could not hold a touch of the originality of it's predecessor (The Man Behind the Mask). The first half hour was most enjoyable, but then it got really tedious very quickly. Maybe that is because I found the original music too boring or maybe the plot wasn't really interesting. I tried calling some good songs, and got such bad dialogs: \"Don't Take That Argument\". Why? The characters were not very impressive and very flat. As far as I can recall, they were looking for a Chinese Sword (三這贜, perhaps?), a demon or a ghost and so on.... You get the point, but that was about all it had to offer. To far as I could tell, the ending was all improvised. I don't know how it ended, but it was just so badly done. The other two episodes (不是陀豪) in the series were even worse, both with the special-effects crew.<br /><br />The title \"The Man who KNEW Too Much\" (\"Whack-head\") was supposed to give the title the same as the film, but unfortunately the producers have left out the second half of the subtitle \"THEREFORE THEY LIVE\" and replaced it with the entire title \"PRESENTED BY:\" which, even if had been the entire title the subtitle would not have fit. This should give you a clue as to how bad the film is about 20 minutes in: the title would not have ruined the movie any.<br /><br />I gave it 0/10 _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have been a huge fan of the book and loved the movie! This adaptation, while faithful to the book, still left a lot of holes in IT and I find that when I watch this film I end up thinking \"What have I just seen?\"<br /><br />The only thing it really had going for it was Catherine Morland (Marian Redfield) and Edward Fox was a much better player in the role. Sadly the other actors in the film (which gave good performances in fact ) weren't even good enough to make this film worth my while.<br /><br />Also if you are a huge fan of the book the series and are planning on watching the movie then save yourself the disappointment and stick to the movie version. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have read all the reviews here on IMDb that have been posted after viewing the film. The most common complaint is the portrayal of Russian characters; particularly by Anton Yelchin, Yelchin is American in Russian (speaking English...), while Yelchin as the Russian character Ekaterina is American in Russian (Kalina is Yelchin's brother). In the documentary style being filmed in the manner by Yakov Saylevich (Yelchin's \"father\"). I felt these aspects are rather stereotypical of how Russians are, although I recognize this may change for the film. For the record, the film as a whole and especially the soundtrack were\n",

      " just's a couple of guys with a video camera who do a lot of \"taste\" and \"light\" film around the local area. It's a nice weekend for all those that enjoy to just waltz through their day just like we did. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ ...but this isn't one of them. Despite an all-star cast, this is just a poor made-for-television movie about a group of poor (now) poor kids who get a new teacher about age 12 and go to the school in which he teaches a program for poor children called \"STEP.\" They make a connection with that new teacher and end up teaching together and even becoming teachers themselves. Oh yeah, at the end a very touching reunion takes place and YOU decide whether or not YOU want to be a teacher. If you want to be a teacher then step into the \"deprogrammer\" role and you will be a great teacher! If you have ANY type of self-worth and care about your students then CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE. They don't use their REAL names and are obviously not ashamed of being BAD PEOPLE! I'd give it 3.5 stars on IMDb and a 5.4 on Metacritic. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is so bad that it can only be compared to a good, old-fashioned horror movie. But, be warned - don't go near this film if you want to have a good time with it! As a film within a film, \"Astroesque\" is well-acted, well-scripted and well-directed. None of the characters are even vaguely likable. They're all obnoxious or uggh! They're the type that just screams NO! You'll probably hear the lines spoken by people behind you in a cinema over and over again (including the famous \"Cinema Paradiso\" ad from Fassbinder's \"Lightning by Night\"). And what could be worse than that? People may have agreed to do a movie like this but they didn't have to! A good message like this is the only reason to create a film like this. That's why the people behind this movie decided to create a film - so they could get a larger, better-known audience. I guess that after seeing what could be considered as the worst film since \"The Godfather\" needs to do something, it's no surprise that they set out to make a new, better, film. This however, isn't \"The Godfather\". This doesn't deserve the \"Godfather\" treatment. I know the movie seems high-budget and action-laden to some people but it's really not. If you want to see a good old-fashioned horror flick but the action is forced and limited (with only about 5 seconds of cool camera-work), you probably won't like this one at all. If you want to laugh at something and enjoy a good-natured but witty movie that's not only good but FUNNY, go with it. On of the best horror movies I've seen in recent times, including the great \"Friday the 13th part 2\" (great movie too), \"Deep Blood\" and the lesser-known, but by far the funniest, \"Crawling\". _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I love the art deco set pieces.<br /><br />They were used in conjunction with the actual paintings, in fine detail. Sometimes it was a little too much, on the big screen too, but that's unavoidable as it's such a well placed part of the movie.<br /><br />The plot, by the way, was excellent. The original dialogue was tight and direct, the supporting players were spot on their parts as well. And there was a sense of fun -- everyone clashing off ideas, styles and perspectives with good humor.<br /><br />One of the first things I noticed was the background audio from the movie. I could just hear the voices of the actors from the movie, in their own voices. I immediately knew who's going to die and who's going up -- I was predicting exactly what I was seeing. As in real life, sometimes this can get a little annoying, but it was not used in this movie.<br /><br />But from that \"diamond in the rough\" to the use of the actual gold, I would say it had a much more high quality than most movies. <br /><br />Overall, though, I think these elements might not be used out in all movies. They just seemed to fit into a movie well enough.<br /><br />I was very surprised by how well it was all put together... _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I went through this movie expecting it to be crap, but nothing of the above ever let me down. A great cast is what made this movie work. A\n",

      "owl, if you're a film student, this is not a good choice. The plot of the film will not only make you cringe with your own stupidity, but it will certainly leave you with something to think about and what you learned about in the course of watching this film. If you want to see some ridiculous action, watch Star Wars!!! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film was excellent not only as it did not leave me with any bad feelings but it left me with a great feeling as well.<br /><br />Not only did the movie take me to another place but it seemed that I was whisked up to their world and into their world. They seemed so down to earth and real.<br /><br />I would say that if you are going to see this film give it a watch it is one of my all time favorites! I am looking for a copy as it was shown several years ago and I think that it should be put out on some DVD. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The film begins with little snippets of a young boy named Louie being asked by other children what they would like to drink. He is asked something in a vague way and then for no apparent reason it shows a child actor who later becomes Loui, who at 20 has his eyes on the object of his desire. A young actress called Catme (Ida Galli) whose name escapes me tries to make an impression on Loui but she does not succeed and Loui soon regains his senses and his love for the young girl named Mai comes back to him and this scene is the ending where Mai meets Loui. The film is in Italy and I have to hand it to the Italians as they did some excellent work on it and at least they brought it back in cinema which no American movie going public would find interesting. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The worst movie I have seen is supposedly based on a true story about a real estate developer named Clarence Dabney who died under suspicious circumstances. Well no matter how much you may believe his denial of his guilt, when you dig beyond his confession, none of it really happened. Even when Clarence's younger brother (Sam), who had been scheduled to blare the death of his brother, shows proof that he knew everything is faked, even he cannot deny that his brother had murdered someone. That leaves only the idea that Clarence can have \"hit the streets\" while Sam and his crew wait for a bail hearing. <br /><br />Well anyway, these \"documentary bits\" are not only fake, but completely irrelevant to the story at hand (I can't imagine anyone believing that Clarence didn't have some control over his men and the way they acted). I really can't imagine what anyone sees in this movie. For instance, on a boat, which is obviously 30 feet deep. Sam and his crew spend the whole time at the shallow shallow well (yes, they stayed there the entire time). How is it that they can cross the 35 foot deep well? The well is 90 degrees? The fact that they managed to keep taking the trip proves they'd crossed it perfectly anyway. And then when Sam and his crew come upon a woman in distress, they immediately send her to someone very far away, which they've determined just happened to be a major metropolitan town. They're in the big city setting in 30 miles. <br /><br />What's really mind-boggling is all of the boat scenes, and not one from a shallow well. A shallow well is miles from anyone's house. And the city setting is made of 2 perfectly separate villages. So how did someone create a deep well in the middle of the ocean? And the entire premise that the City Hall building was once the home of a bravely fighting Catholic parishioner? Sam's friends fought and overcame adversity, but it's really a stupid myth. This was a bad movie. The actors weren't bad and it's funny that Sam's brother was a thief. But in general, I found this garbage a waste of time to watch and $1 to watch, not the horror of having an actor portraying something horrible make-up on their body. Thank God I rented it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I didn't expect anything from this movie, but I did expect something I could relate to. This is the type of movie where the only character believable in the mind of the lead character, is the lead, himself. However, I feel that the movie never really tells the audience what's going on backstories for these characters. I have no idea what Martin and Lewis were doing in this movie, but what I did see was a fairly typical suburbanite story, with an Asian sideburn/neighborhood that gets very very annoying. I don't think this movie should stand as precedent for how to write a sequel for a movie like this one, with maybe some\n",

      " down a guy who looks like a skeleton, but is really a skeleton, walking around, hanging around, scaring people, etc. The movie also introduces a new type of ghost, the spooky black girl who can control the blood in your shot, and she is also very very funny, despite being ugly. The way the movie is set up, you begin watching, and you are waiting for the revelations, and the twist is, the black girl's spirit comes back and she is still sitting there, but there isn't anything waiting for anyone to do. I will say the performance from some of the actors does help. The rest of the acting is good, but nothing to write home about. Overall this movie was bad, and I was looking forward to it, but was very disappointed. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ First of all, don't go into Revolver expecting another Snatch. Too many similarities between the two movies to remember. And while the first movie was a great thriller, Revolver seems to be filled with coincidences that make no sense, and make you wonder if the movie even had a plot. And what's worse is that the twists in the Revolver are almost non-existent. If someone says the name of the Revolver villain, you know who it is, even though it might not be the closest person in the movie to you. You've heard of the man, you've seen the man, you've seen the man two times. Why Revolver fails, I don't know.<br /><br />Revolver is about a drug that sends you up and down, like a bad dream. It has some very nice production, and the people involved should be commended. But it all just seems a little off. There's a twist about some character in the beginning and an especially intriguing (we'll get to that) ending, but these elements add nothing to the overall picture. Sometimes it feels like the movie has been cut longer than it needs to be just to fit into time. All in all, it's a great thriller if you want a good laugh, see it with some sober friends, and then have a good beer afterwards. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It's hard to make an unbiased judgment for a film like this. You have to stand along with the people who gave it good reviews, or else you might not get where some of us do. To me the story and direction seemed to be the strongest points of those particular film. I like this movie. I watched it often in the 70s, and my children loved it. I only wish I'd tucked it away in a drawer. I miss the animation. And the voice acting was fair. Some of the characters got annoying. All in all I can give it four out of five stars, because the premise, characters and the overall storyline of the movie are excellent. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I watched this when it came out, but my daughter, who is 15, said that it wasn't as bad as she remembered. I have always claimed that the movie in itself was not nearly as bad as she claimed. I have not seen the TV version, even though I have seen several trailers for the movie. <br /><br />However, this version had an extra dose of realism, which the TV version lacked. This might change if she were willing to put-off college for a while. The best way to approach this movie is to read the synopsis online and if you are familiar with the book, then compare the modern TV version with the detailed synopsis. Because she did not like the movie, I am not going to waste my time going through the trouble of writing about the plot. I can only say that the movie does not have flaws like the book, but it does have numerous things that I would not have thought possible. In particular, the characters who were involved with the film during a major scene did a very good job of acting in their roles. The fact that the TV version could not emulate such a movie in any way (e.g. the lack of a sound track) is a major fault of the TV production. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Just to let everyone know, the movie \"Sandy Hook\" is one of those rare movies that's both wonderful and terrifying at the same time. The film tells the story of the first Sandy Hook shooting, a small town in Connecticut where a young girl is targeted in a horrific act of violence by a man who claims to be a troubled ex-convict.<br /><br />The film takes us from the fateful day of the shooting, over 30 days and reveals the most horrific of the horrific three weeks in the lives of the elementary school students. It also shows the bravery of every single person involved in bringing this horrific crime to a very public airing.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this yet, I recommend\n",

      " city's best to the greatest. Not only that, but in terms of having great music and memorable lines, the show ranks up there with a lot of programs in terms of best writing.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into the drama that the show has to go through since it's a while ago, but you would have to be a kid to enjoy some of the show's scenes. The show's a parody of a lot of things and everyone's lives are irrelevent at times.<br /><br />I really like this show. I wouldn't give the show a 10 out of 10 because the show doesn't try so hard to be a hit show like many other shows are trying today. I just get it and go along with it. I love it because when something really shocking comes on a show, it doesn't look like it's just a bunch of cheesy stuff thrown together. It has a really good cast. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am a huge Disney fan!! and for 2d it never fails to amuse me. There are some funny scenes in here which definitely entertain you. I love this movie and never get tired of watching it! It is so good that now this year, I have decided to buy a whole box set of all the short films!! which i have been looking forward to and i have to say i do not regret purchasing this little movie!! the film is very funny and very entertaining. Everything the bit where Pete stands a little awkward at times but he makes up for it by being super funny! my only regret is i didn't get to see the Filthy McNasty prequel movie that was on there. If you get the chance to see this film you definitely should!! I watched the other half of the Filthy McNasty movie and i wish I would of seen more of the villain but overall i love the fx of this film! I think all the short films make an entertaining soundtrack and the talent of some of the actors is well ahead of most of the other actors out there. this movie is highly worth your time and you will really enjoy the experience. The scenes when the kids are taking the bus to school is funny in how it is set up in a school bus. I love these bits when the kids pass the school to go to school. i love this part where Pete is telling everyone to take the bus and as the bus leaves he makes a little gesture and the kids on the bus stop and inform the driver that they are no longer taking the bus. I would also like to point out the funny bits on Pete's bus that i just mentioned and if you are a fan of Pete then i hope that you will like this film as i have and recommend it to a fellow fan!! happy viewing :) _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ OK I've actually seen this movie, it's a really bizarre movie for sure. Especially in the beginning I thought \"what the hell is this\". <br /><br />But upon watching it and there was actually quite a funny plot twist at the end, made me rather happy.. but strange sometimes.<br /><br />I thought there was lots of things mixed up with this movie, but I guess not, it just seems like a normal movie, but a strange one.<br /><br />I thought that the movie was strange, I thought the acting was strange, but oddly... It must be a mixture because there is some odd acting.. But it isn't really weird, it's just strange.<br /><br />The music is good, kinda out of place it seems, and the music at the end was good.. it was really out of place.<br /><br />But oh well, this is a strange tale and at the end its just a simple message to say.. I don't know if its a good story but I do know why some people think it was a weird movie, but it is... This is really a strange movie... _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ After finally watching PUCK 'TAKING ITS HEAD OFF' my teenage daughter and I found ourselves so fed up with the endless repetition of childish antics and terrible 'comedy' that it was having in our life. The only thing that had endured was our snail slow down not allowing the film to draw us into its world. When the film finally got us to engage and lose ourselves in its world and into the true essence of life we gave up laughing and became busy, unengaged. No film should do this to you, don't, it will only leave you bitter in return. That would be so sad and would be so extreme to the truth. It is however a very very rare example of something we could enjoy if we gave it the brain and spirit it most of the time. <br /><br />If we simply accept life as it is, then I feel we could enjoy and benefit from living our best natures.

      " have been for those viewers at the beginning who have not seen that early movie. The best bit has been watching Seagal play another part of another role as the bad guy and even more of those are things which have been done a couple of times before. A few of them in this movie are kind of awesome. Like, I remember watching an old scene when they were going through the garage just before the villain said \"Just look there!\" or some like that. There's also two or so other old scenes in here which are really cool even if they have been done a million times before. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It's too bad that John Saxon was not allowed to continue to write the classic screenplays for movies. His skills of dialogue and characterization are simply amazing, and his unique style of working as a producer is undeniable. The story of the famous Battle of Stalingrad deserves to be truly rediscovered. The film is now available at last on DVD, and I suggest watching it with the commentary, a biographical introduction, and a re-imagining of the battle, with historical perspective. Saxon plays the part of a great Russian in this very unique and very entertaining story of World War II. His talent shines even more brilliantly than in his best-known role, The Legend of Boggy Creek. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am usually not a fan of documentaries or the like, but I thought I'd give it a chance. One thing i noticed about this film from the box in the discotheque section is that the women painted their breasts black. This surprised me since i know they were supposed to be nude throughout the entire movie, but i do wonder what the purpose of this little tribute was. If this was the best of the Memorial, then i am truly appreciating the other parts. There has never been a greater need to re-watch the whole thing. To be more precise, however, one part of the Memorial that really annoyed me was when the Commander recounted the events of the last great battle to the death. While watching the broadcast of this battle, i noticed the commentator refer to the Battle of Stalingrad once, two times, four times during the course of the battle, all done without ever mentioning an obvious outcome. However, i was unable to witness this battle as it was mentioned by the other commanders. The conclusion of the Commander's speech seemed almost in the same breath to me, but i found this so illogical that i no longer found the topic of an entire battle to be relevant to the conclusion of a war. Maybe the Commander's speech was a good one, but then i also found the way the battle was called by the names assigned to it very odd. I have not done a complete search on the internet to locate this particular broadcasted event, but i am certain that a name will be forthcoming when it is made available. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ A good film, which entertains without being simply \"cute\", but with plenty of it to keep one's attention. I especially liked the \"come back\" scenes. Of course this is NOT a film for the faint of heart, but I am a big fan of the whole \"hollywood-product\" thing...I just hope it is well worth searching the web for. Just don't go see it for the ending, that will be a disappointment. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ How do I begin? This film has a fantastic opening shot/shot then drags as if nothing in the off-screen events ever happened. After this, the film becomes an embarrassing mess, and one that I have to sit through repeatedly. There were times when I could tell if the film was trying to develop the feel of \"funny\" that the director/writer had in his mind. But as soon as some \"humor\" was necessary to the film, the humor sucked. I was going to give it a 4. To describe it \"funny\" would be giving it too much rope. The only thing funny was the fact that I was at least entertained by the movie. If you like your films \"funny\", see \"Bogart\". _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I don't know why this movie has what's wrong in Hollywood. If this was set in a gym, the set would look like the old T&A movie with a kick of the heels. The young actors come and they're awesome in this movie and they should all go into bigger and better things. This is a movie about what happens when you try to do the right thing. You're trapped in a threesome, you don't fit in, you're gay, and you're powerful. I like this movie so much that I buy it so that my DVD collection goes in there. This is the film on which the \"good\" movie stands. _\n",

      ". One thing I noticed: while I was watching the film I couldn't seem to relate to any character. Not even the jolly gormless, pompous upper crust mayor of town.<br /><br />What a dog of a movie.<br /><br /> _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain historical fact, that it does contain fact, that anything said or done in this movie is purely fictional. As always, I think it was a brilliant decision not to weave the history of St. Louis into the plot - just enough of a story to make a statement about it, but not so much a story about the true events of the fight, or a \"twist\" about St. Louis as the writer chose.<br /><br />The story itself is fascinating, but as usual, the narrative and filming style make it more powerful than it needs to be. Because of the excellent cinematography, you can tell the writer knows what he's doing and he prefers to let the story flow. The character development is well done in this movie. Every character is solid in their own way. At two, the characters vary greatly but remain true to the spirit of the title.<br /><br />The acting makes it the best film of the year, so go give it a look. As always, I'm giving it a 10/10. As always, I'm giving it a 10/10. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Although I like this kind of adventure, I don't recommend this one. It was enjoyable if you enjoyed The Princess Bride, of course, but there isn't any relationship between them. It also was very entertaining if you enjoyed The Rock. Actually, they were very entertaining together, which also makes me dislike this movie. It wasn't like The Royal Tenenbaums, D-War, or I, Robot, and it takes place in Antarctica, but it is still very entertaining as well. It is definitely better. But please, go back and rent The Odyssey if you like adventure. I'd say if you liked The Princess Bride, I'd say you should watch The Legend of Fandango before this one. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I thought it was an enjoyable movie, and all the actors did a good job. My only minor criticism is that the \"twist\" ending was rather hard to swallow, but that makes it pretty good! Overall, I'm pleased to have this as a part of my film collection. It's definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />A note: The movie is named the Deadly Angel Project, but it's really a B-movie, so don't go off searching for that. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I think this is perhaps the best movie that I've ever seen. I love everything that this film has going for it in general. It has good storyline, good character development, good characters and a very strong message about good in this age. What a great soundtrack this one has. Don't be afraid of language, it's part of the message of the film. The actors were all very good. It has been a long time since I have seen such a strong story, such a plot with good characters and well formed characters. I strongly recommend all who see this movie to go see it the this time. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Yes, this is one of the better movies we have just seen because it brings us up for a scare. We have seen many gore films before but none that scare like this one. The acting is better than usual. If you are a horror fan go and see this one as it has its own unique style. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is not a complete waste of time if you can find a copy somewhere that will give you peace of mind, a new hobby for the future. This is a movie that makes fun of itself and has quite a few good laughs. So the plot might be rather simple, but that is not important. The premise is not really bad either, and there are no great surprises, but I recommend seeing this film for entertainment, and if you don't have a copy, definitely buy it. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The story has a nice and clever opening first, and then the action begins, and I must assure you, that you are not going to want any coffee or food at the moment. The acting is good (I found all of them to be quite convincing), with all actors delivering their lines well. And the story is really sweet.<br /><br />The opening credits are well done by the director, who gave this movie it's hook. He also made the movie really funny, with some great lines.<br /><\n",

      " film in this way. I guess \"realism\", in this case, isn't a methodology. Acknowledging the comic-book aesthetic is in itself not enough. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"House of Dracula\" is good fun, but it's not exactly high quality. I rented this thing because I thought, \"Hey, this could really be interesting!\" Then I found out that House is a one story horror, so you know that there's some quality to the movie too, but House isn't a remake, so I'll have to do some serious thinking on how to give this film a good score.<br /><br />I'd first rented this thing back when I was seven or eight years old, back when the house and/or Castle Bleu were the same. As I've said before, House is not the remake of Castle Bleu, but this movie does a nice job of mixing classic horror with modern pseudo-horror. House of Dracula features some of Bram Stoker's classic novels, like \"Dracula\" in the same way that Dracula's Castle is used to tell the story of Dracula in this film. I think the movie does a nice job of taking us into the mind of Dracula as he looks for a cure for his affliction and holding our interest for what ends up happening to him. This is just a nice little movie that is fun to watch, and because it is a horror flick, it doesn't have to mean that it is scary. Like what happens to Dracula when he learns that he just might be cured at the end. Some of the special effects look like they were done at Universal Studios, and the old man was just as creepy as the were, but overall, House of Dracula is not the biggest classic horror flick, so I've had it with just about every House of Dracula movie I've ever watched. That said, this House of Dracula movie wasn't great and really falls into the trap that most Dracula movies have. It wasn't the greatest of the series, but it was a fun one and easily watch, so I give it a pretty good 7.3 out of 10!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I can't believe how many people who give this movie a good rating and generally rave about its quality are in reality, mentally deficient, drug and alcohol dependent losers who watch this movie only because it features \"Lance Nielson,\" a man who is on the verge of falling off the face of the earth, who can't get up off of his keyboard, who can't solve a \"data\" puzzle, can't solve a \"who's who\" problem, whose computer will freeze if he tries, and can't get a decent night's sleep, etc. Oh yes, Lance's best friend, Detective Sgt. Faal (Ron Eldard), is also a \"data\" freak, and they watch this awful guy's \"data\" at gunpoint and mail him back to Nielson, who never comes back. The \"horror\" is that Nielson keeps getting killed, and this movie is just an ongoing disaster, and every five seconds someone is dying. I can't believe how many people were in this movie when I was seven-years-old. When the movie was finished, my mom and I were very touched by this movie, and a lot of the comments left to our review on the IMDb were really kind. Good job, I thought, but this movie really needs to be released in theaters and to be seen in the theaters. As things stand, I would buy this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ There is a good story, and a great story told here, but the plot and the direction took a nose-dive early on, and the actors here lacked the ability and desire to do what the film deserved, and did very little, to make it worth their while. All aspects of the movie could have been handled better by a competent writer. The use of POV doubles did nothing but confuse and distract the audience, and seemed to invite disaster. Had the story been handled differently and was there any real insight in the plot, the character would most likely have been more likable, which in turn, would also have made the film a much more enjoyable experience. We had some nice cinematography and very interesting locations, yet the script was poorly written. The final outcome felt like a cop out, and a poor script was the cause and not the acting, directing, or production. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I rented this movie on two DVD's and I can't believe I wasted ANYTIME on it! I was warned, if you rent this one DON'T! It's one of the first and most disgusting kind of \"horror films\", as there are no \"genuine\" moments of horror, just disgusting screams, running out of character and becoming indistinguishable from the audience.

      " how a young boy cannot relate to a world with a thousand other realities. The characters and their relationships are the star of this comedy which is not without its many spoofish moments. It is also a very powerful drama as the three lead men are dealt with by a series of more conventional and not always effective ways. It is an interesting departure in many ways and it is quite reminiscent of early sitcoms (House) of the late thirties. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I know that these sorts of shows aren't even in the channels anymore, but they're still enjoyable, and I have to say \"Fantasy Island is a one-of-a-kind show\".<br /><br />The basic premise is that each contestant creates a realistic fantasy about a specific season in their life. It's an amazing show, and I always tell myself, it's one of the few shows out there where I'd watch it again and again for centuries to come.<br /><br />The challenges are hard though, even though the contestants appear to have great support systems. You have creative tension such as \"Survivor\" style. I am still waiting for my show. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I just don't know what the hell was in the movie. The dialog was so pathetic. The actors must've spent all day on it, and got paid to do it. The plot wasn't even believable. The police powers in England are obsolete. What's with that stupid thing where he always seems to be the first one to enter a club. What about the dumbest grin I've ever seen in a man? And the way he always gets the **** in the cinema. When I sat in a cinema waiting for the video/dvd I'd walk out with a full stomach of lager beer.<br /><br />I can't believe it was made in England. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ To be perfectly honest, I am more amazed that the comment above actually works. Actually, I know most of the cast names, because all the actors in this film have either signed up for another film, or are doing television on TV...<br /><br />I'm actually going to give an opinion about this film that all other comments here are pathetic and unfulfilled. Yes, it's a decent film, and for a while was a little surprising that it was made in South Korea. However, in retrospect, it seems really lame to cast the likes of Jason Statham, Jessica Lange, and Jennifer Tilly as a teenager (with the intention of getting them to turn pro) and not much later, having the girls grow up into porn stars.<br /><br />Don't the boys aged so much? Are they getting paid a lot less than what they could be? I hope they got the money for the makeover but the whole shoddy visual design and dialogue wasn't worth the $9 I paid them to see this.<br /><br />I really hope this movie can be viewed by enough people to not feel the need to vomit in our face to justify spending time to write this. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a terrible ripoff of B-Movie classic \"High Art\", the original featuring Kevin Kline. High art had a bunch of women (most of them friends of the lead) in bikinis and tight clothing. Those days are gone and not even Vickie Guerrero's nasty-looking biker-esque body can hold a candle to this. If only \"Bachelorette\" was that good an investment. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is like watching a bunch of family members getting ready to party. One generation blames the next generation for all their problems, another generation blames the next generation. We throw in all the sexual promiscuity, the drug abuse, the abortion, and every other cr*ppy liberal cliche that gets thrown into the mix. It never seems to connect or connect, and the fact that it does so with a cheap grin and 'Let's Go Blue Juice!' at all times, makes me have to think that perhaps I should just get out of the cinema and go over the script with a big fat and dried-up rag that had already been cut. No chances of that here folks.... _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film was so poorly directed, the 'maze-like' shots were laughably awful, and I had the feeling throughout the film that I was watching a terrible sitcom. The acting was terrible; in fact this might even be a straight-to-DVD ripoff of the now-classic series 'The Dana-Babies'. And the 'medical' nonsense was appalling; if this was a case of a severely ill patient going completely psycho and getting himself \"treated\", well, these people are on a\n",

      " standards for them that they have made great careers of. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The most disturbing thing of this film is not that it portrays gay life in a humiliating and degrading fashion, but that it's downright dangerous: It makes fun of both gay and straight in a way that juries might find equanimation in -- and judge behavior (behavior) on -- the level of a bunch of juries might. It's also dangerous in that it so blatantly and maliciously invents the spectre of moral equivalence and calls up a whole host of paranoid and prejudiced legal practices which straight people (especially middle-class gay men) and some women (especially women predjudicating by age, income and experiences of life) see as a sort of real or passable condition. This is a film to be seen as a piece of fiction, to be paraded as fact, to be cherished beside the fiction of real people, and to be loved for the entertainment value of reflecting on its intent and style as an example of how people are actually moralized or worse, who dare to be any different in their judgments. If the goal of this film was \"to make [gay] life a joke,\" then it should have succeeded. As it stands, though, it's very dry, dated and even pandering to the desires and prejudices of a very few people. It's not even \"entertaining,\" as its aim is apparently to \"make others laugh.\" Instead, it ends up creating ambivalence not only between its own efforts and goals, but also between the people who inhabit its fictional \"territory.\" The most entertaining portions of the film depend largely on the actors' and actresses' insistence on coming off as gay stereotypes rather than outright fictional persons inhabiting the stories they create. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ this Movie was very poorly made, bad-cast, crappy effects, bad sound, terrible action. the only good things in this movie are (in no particular order):<br /><br />1. Peter Cushing, his good acting; 2. the \"creatures\" (actors) have a great acting, even the CGI is good.<br /><br />the rest is just garbage. it was terrible-made, bad-acted and not in the least bit scary looking. even the CGI looked fake. the only \"trying\" at these movies is bad writing and dialogue, that's it.<br /><br />even this is too much to pass, and once you do, you'll never get back those few minutes you wasted watching this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have to admit that I like horror movies, even ones that are dumb like Werewolf. I like monster movies and I try to get as many from each genre as possible. However, this one was just WAY too boring. It had no drive in this movie. This was a horrible attempt to make a movie, and a horrible attempt at making a comedy. The acting was just plain awful. And the effects looked HORRIBLE! I know the first one with the wolf man looked like a great movie, but this one was lacking so much spirit. It was like the effects fell into the typical clichés and let the movie fail.<br /><br />The movie just turned out to be really bad. Well, I don't want to be too harsh just because it was a horrible movie, but the only reason I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 instead of the 1 on the review was the acting. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Not much to say about this film other than this - it had good intentions, but as others have already noted, they are nowhere near being the whole story.<br /><br />I saw this film when it first came out, and even then it was a disappointment. Its obvious budget was obviously limited, but its message was never evident - in fact, the film's biggest enemy is itself, and the results are clear.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted - this is most like a Chris Lehmann film, except that its a comedy - and I fail to see how anyone could find this anything but unpalatable. Given that this film had nothing to redeem it, I must conclude that the critics gave it \"too much\" - I have nothing to disagree with. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. While there were some factual errors, especially in the U.K. and Germany there is nothing outrageous about these facts. The actor who played Adolf is actually a lot closer to Hitler than most of the Hollywood \"Charts\" producers and actors who played Hitler at least did some research. This is a \"history lesson\" I would agree with! On the other hand this film is an extremely funny laugh about all the facts of the world's \"history\" and\n",

      " zombie and some pretty nasty ones too. The acting was very poor and the story was very thin.<br /><br />In conclusion i see why first time movie making has a hard time being successful. The movie had a lot of potential but the screenplay needed to be made a lot better. Besides this, this movie failed to deliver any suspense for 2 reasons 1) There wasn't enough suspense 2) The movie was too short and besides the reason 1) being released in a time of Hollywood, they need to make at least 3 hour movie, which they should definitely do, otherwise they won't be able to take the chance with their sequels.<br /><br />Final impression: Just because someone is a famous director, can't make 2 hour movie with their celebrity 3) They need to make at least 3 hour movie with their famous director + 2 hour movie with extra footage to be Oscar worthy movie.<br /><br />In a next words, Don't try. Best of luck next time ... _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ If you thought \"Fate of the Vampire Slayer\" was horrible, then you've got nothing to do on planet Cybil. You can't just go around and kill people, you have to take them apart one by one and put them in their place and break their bones until they are reduced to mere bones. This show was an insult to the VLD franchise. The way they introduced new characters and how the new ones relate to the originals was wrong. For an adult, this show is awful and will make you feel as guilty as giving a child a methadrine. This show tried to make the VLD's anime-like characters and stories appealing and even cute. They tried to make the show appealing to a higher intelligence level by using humor on it.<br /><br />Don't watch this show. If you want to watch an example of why you should not watch the most popular series on TV, go buy the DVD of the original TV series and avoid this show. You will have much more enjoyable experiences. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ As you might know it's very late at night, so my job as an IT consultant is a bit easier. I watch a bit of \"House of Ice and Chair\" and have been watching the repeats since it was on ITV. Then I finally got the \"Harry Vardon Show\" on DVD. Why ITV? The only 2 channels on ITV are BBC/A&E and then ITV news. After watching about the first 20 minutes I found the whole entertainment of \"Harry Vardon\" I found quite boring. Then I watched the rest - 20 minutes in I found my self watching the repeats in reverse chronological order with the beginning of the show at exactly the right time for me. To tell you the truth Vardon is ITV's biggest ever audience star.<br /><br />They tried to create this \"Vardon\" by dropping in lots of big names such as \"David Letterman\", \"Charlie Davis\", \"Jay Leno\", \"Jay Richards\", etc. I am told that Leno and Letterman are in serious talks to star in the show and thats sad b/c there is not more than 1 Leno episode to star in. It reminds me of an episode of the \"Frank and Harriet\" TV show.<br /><br />Anyway they dropped Leno so much that when I watched the first 15 minutes I didn't have any idea where it was taking place or who it was for. Now obviously I had seen some episodes before but when I watch the first 15 minutes of Leno I only realised it was Leno.<br /><br />I have always had this enjoyment when watching TV series because I feel that I am part of the character. So it is not important what Leno says or does, the people who matter. Vardon's personality is very straight forward and objective. The people in this show matter. At the end of the day if they were putting out some really slick ads to recruit new viewers it would be fine - but it wouldn't be because they would want to scare people into watching because that is not what the premise of the show is about. So why bring in the guys who bring you the latest Michael Jackson music video or the latest Jon Jonestown concert in order to make you go to their website to check out what they do and how they cover it! So I ask. What the f? On top of that they have a huge girl following of which is why the show is a complete flop. People who like the show are very keen on a review from VD's personal website which says: \"As a Citizen of the world...Villex - comedian, actor and designer - presents his best creative work for entertainment and learning. As a gamer...Villex...enjoy\" The above text is the perfect setup for an advert. I am also glad that my son who is 6 was fascinated with this show. He watched the\n",

      "ant, the \"good bad-guy.\" In the sequel, the same actors were given very mediocre performances. The plot was the same, but so was the dialogue. I guess they were trying to cover up a plot hole in the script. So I guess it's now a running joke.<br /><br />This is also very bad-movie material. The violence and gore, while quite plentiful in the first two installments, are very subdued in this movie, so it really hurt the feelings of the target audience. A lot of actors give surprisingly good performances when given the opportunity, however, particularly in the end scenes. I especially like the way that every enemy is made white, or at least almost completely white, even that nasty gang that was so prominently featured in the first movie. But the film was made in the late 80s, so maybe people who were in that era don't like it as much as people who are used to watching much more extreme, violent films.<br /><br />The music used throughout is also very good, however. The score uses the theme from the first movie, but places it a little bit differently in this one. And although I am not a big Rush fan, I found their use of the track here very cool. Sometimes using a lot of the same things over and over makes sense, especially when the context is so relevant to the plot. But unfortunately, this film has so much going against it that it ends up becoming an annoyance instead of a source of enjoyment. I wish I could tell you the ending, but I can't. It's like any other dated or awkward 30's movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I first saw Holes at a local theater showing, and thought it was a first-rate piece of cinematic achievement. It is nothing if not a masterpiece, and a good introduction to the world of science fiction and science fiction in general. While I am not entirely sure what the film was about or where it came from, it has certain timeless qualities that I can't quite identify. I had no idea what the film looked like on the surface, but upon further inspection, have since learned that it was a prequel to the future killer clown series that appeared in The Great Mouse Detective. Put this and all the other curious quirks of the film aside, and it is very nice to actually CARE about what is occurring on the screen. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ My girlfriend wanted to see this movie as part of a \"blah blah blah\" themed movie night, so we picked the movie which we thought would give us the horror movie we were after. Nothing could have prepared us for what we found ourselves staring at our black friend's feet in the theater.<br /><br />How in the world can a movie be made about such a concept be ruined by a flat out lazy screenplay and director who has way too much to do to try to make the whole thing look interesting? I was watching with dark corners figured out the way to survive and survive. I can't even come around here and defend this movie. It's not even worth my time. I laughed a few times and I tried to look for any kind of redeeming quality to it. Its just too pretentious to be a genuinely good movie and was obviously made with a total lack of any kind of ambition or actual training or investment.<br /><br />You know, maybe the filmmakers were trying to give credibility to the ideas about brain transplants and other potential medical breakthroughs but then what would you expect in the world of Hollywood. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ If you've ever had a bad day in the cinema - well, this is exactly the film to blame, as it doesn't give a single good or enjoyable moment. Just about every aspect of the film seems to be filled with a complete disregard for the audience...<br /><br />First off, it is extremely difficult to get into 'Suicide Squad' by anyone other than an extremely lazy person, so really the only people who will want to watch this film are die-hard 'Suicide Squad' fans. The plot is incredibly stupid and as we all know, not very good. The movie is over twice the length (1000 times!) as dull and boring than a good hard liquor.<br /><br />I really can't understand why Suicide Squad has attracted so many fans, when it is nothing but a piece of garbage! We have seen the same movie that six months ago killed six people. We were laughing our arses off. If they are making a sequel or spin off from this one, they should do it well or at least give the director some more original ideas.<br /><br />I can only assume this has been written by a suicidal maniac thinking that just because a suicide has occurred, his buddies (or, dare i say friends) will turn up to help him carry out his deed. To take such risks just proves\n",

      "_REVIEW_ I had to change my mind...this movie should be taken some of the way out. Bad script. Bad director. They just didn't have any talent at all for this movie...and they should never be allowed to make a movie ever again... <br /><br />My vote 1/2/''(Reviewer)''<br /><br />(Vote): Avoid<br /><br />(I was waiting for this to get better and then got to the end.) _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The only reason to see this movie is to see Gabriel Byrne and Gabriella Carter playing superheroes in a love story. Their is really not much else for this couple. After a couple of weeks on the planet this may be somewhat entertaining movie. However, I could not see too many characters in this film. The plot is almost non-existent. There is only the one main character that keeps popping up out of nowhere for no reason. The dialogue is terrible and the movie just seems to drag. It's not completely awful but it is rather slow. The last hour or so is spent running around just to make a few different characters pop out of nowhere! It really is an hour and twenty minutes that I will never get back on either. So if you are looking for something to watch on TV tonight or feel like a rainy evening pass please do! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I have seen this movie twice and it is awesome. They make the movie worth seeing though. The actor that played a good part of this one was killed off at the beginning. Anyway I want to see this movie again after I get some extra goodies from them. The actor who played the librarian just wanted to wear an ear piece so he had to wear a heavy duty helmet and had to wear over thick glasses. The voice of the little boy in the movie was a good version too. You can't really say he didn't act funny at all. I think you would need to see it to know! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was lucky enough to see this with my brother and a friend. Being the only two people in the theatre at the very time of showtime I was the only one who dared to peek up from. This movie doesn't just make fun of wrestling, it also lampoons it.<br /><br />I mean, look at the scene where Brian Zahling catches himself getting a drink from a Coke bottle. How ironic a moment when all the guys sitting around should be thanking their lucky stars that the guy actually popped up. Or, take that moment Mike Sullivan is telling the guy to \"drop it\" as he lifts a light shade of beer into his mouth and smacks him on the back of the head, creating yet another ironic comedic scene.<br /><br />Zachs' comedic timing in the movie also shines through, particularly from his interactions with O.J.:MALLEY. When the two appear on screen, I just about gasped, remembering what his moments looked like and hearing the exact same things that I heard. The only time I didn't think his moments were quite as funny was when he was addressing the camera directly to a camera. <br /><br />The scene I remember most is the one where he is watching the football game with his dad and the other sports reporter. The way that he appears to be enjoying himself more by the game was as if he was literally spitting out a bad rant. You'd have to have an IQ of close to lightning to get any kind of film with this guy in it, because he's brilliant. <br /><br />All around, this movie is genius. The writing is also very clever, but not at all ha-ha-ha-hah. This movie is just very funny, very funny, and very funny! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was lucky enough to see the film for its first major North American premiere at London's Royal Albert Hall, where it was due to wrap up after a two day Festival. The story is based on the true incident of this eminent Swedish physicist Karl Roden, who was working on a small metal cylinder as part of his physics research.<br /><br />When the device was failing, Roden found a new way to make it work. The story, which is so funny it borders on the tragic, involves Roden and his secret wife with his brother and the two must have been out together on his life, especially since Roden lives in his former hometown, and he lives in a semi-permanent abode there, while his wife lives in a mansion on the edge of the picturesque English country.<br /><br />This film was so funny, that at times, the audience was sobbing, with laughter mixed with the raw honesty shown in the story. The physicist is not shown as either villain or hero, but a\n",

      ", but in \"The End of The Affair\" it's still a thoroughly gripping piece of cinema.<br /><br />Buster Keaton, Walter Brennan and David Warner are just an extraordinary piece of American cinema.<br /><br />Their performance is the central focus of this film, and for the most part they really do a good job. But I found the actors to be unconvincing, to be honest. Their character's voices were sometimes comical (just watch what happens when Captain Drive-in calls the secretary). In any case, it isn't very distracting.<br /><br />On the other hand David Warner really does a magnificent job. His performance is very affecting and he also makes the most out of the one-note character he plays. The only thing I didn't like with him was the over-aggressive overacting (his character is essentially a good guy but he pulls it off with ease). Also too much time is spent on his character when the film is running low on energy but that's not distracting.<br /><br />In short then, \"The End of the Affair\" is solid entertainment. The whole film is really worth your time in my opinion. It's both funny and dramatic and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />9/10 _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ Okay I know I'm no hip-swinging Millennial and have only experienced first-hand youth culture binges a zillion times now and recently with other first-hand teens. I know it's all about the Bay Area and stuff. But come on. This movie is awful. It's the type of movie that would not only be bad visually, it's awful in what it's about. It's like a second-rate action/adventure/thriller/gore flick from the early to mid-90s. I like those types of movies but this was absolute torture sitting through. If you're a fan of directors like Byron Wade or John Carpenter, this movie is a definite must-see one if you're in the mood for a bad movie. Otherwise, you're better off renting \"Jaws\", \"Blood Surf\" or any of the recent \"B\" horror flicks. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I saw this as a child and it was beautiful, bright, and wonderful - and now, I am 42 years old and I still love it. It has a wonderful and believable plot. The acting is great (I was 22). I have been married 7 times and I live with 3 of my girlfriends - one of which was 13 when she was in first grade - and she repeats the best/worst character in the story each time. So, like I said before, for me this was great - \"it is about a little girl who misses her daddy.\" It is beautiful, bright, and lovely! I would love to take my little girl to this movie again - and I have several of them. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a total bore.I went to see it yesterday and can't even be bothered to think what the movie is about.The acting was terrible,and some of the situations were very bad choices for actors. It was pretty obvious that they just couldn't believe they made a movie of this quality. All they did was swear constantly and make mistakes that were not funny. The story is not that original,it's a re-picture of a real/dead tv series,and should have never been made.<br /><br />There are a lot of movies based on characters.This one is just a variation on that. If you do see this movie, relax. Don't waste your time. Read a book! _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I just want to let all of you know that I got to talk to Kris Kristofferson. I had the chance to talk to him about something that might have been worth hearing but Kris did not want to talk about it. I understand there has not been much out of his life, but what does exist is that pretty much everybody I have ever met has never heard of him. I'm one of the ones who have never really heard of him and have considered him a lost one. I hope I never get to meet him but, just so you know, I will if the chance presents itself. A friend of mine once knew him and would gladly talk to anyone about him. Some people in the music community have seen him as a regular guy and I've been following him since I was 15, so I guess in any case I'm not sure what to believe. Either way, I have never been involved in anything that he has been involved with. He is a wonderful talent, I agree with all those who say a must see him in some kind of semi-regular role. I think a lot of what everyone is posting here is how absolutely obsessed\n",

This was just a terrible movie with a very, very very shallow premise and if I could, I would have thrown the watermelon that was right over my head. Some things just didn't add up and it didn't even make sense. There was a part with the bad guys that was not necessary to the story. The bad guys were just bad guys and no one was able to save the day, which is not realistic. The worst scene was when the bad guys kill the captain and no one was able to save the day. When the bad guys kill the captain I was just surprised by the fact that that he was not holding a gun. And when they were first toting out that gun I was just like....nah I guess I wasn't too dumb a person not to notice...he had a gun and was willing to shoot it or something. I would have thrown the watermelon if that was possible. If they were playing for real. Maybe if the watermelon was actually a character and it was right across my head I would have been more forgiving and I would not have laughed so much. That was just plain dumb. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ A really ridiculous and clichéd war film. It's really hard to find a redeeming quality in this movie, but one that does succeed at causing both laughs and pain. The cast would probably agree with me when I say that the acting ranges from bad to just plain dreadful. Some of these 'actors' did have one or more impressive resumes, but for whatever reason their roles don't fully register and when properly executed they can make this film a laughing stock. The scene where the 'Marines' are looking at an enemy machine gun nest and one of their guns goes off accidentally into the swamp, and the Marine with the ammo box is dragged out of the swamp by the 'Marines' is pretty incredible, to say the least. The 'Marines' seem to be aware of what they have (and don't have) on their hands, but for whatever reason, they still pull out their guns and fire without losing any sight of the gun. In an extremely clichéd finish there is one moment when a suicide bomber explodes his payload across the sky, we are left wondering 'how did we miss him?' This film is a fairly accurate depiction of war, but the situation it depicts is unfortunately all too real. I will definitely watch this movie again, if for nothing else because I sure am sure that I will find something that represents my military experience in a much more accurate way. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is the one I've seen most when I've watched it. It is a film which could not be better made, beautifully shot and acted, and the story is a great one. I found it hard to believe that the young boys the filmmakers chose to try and capture, are really young boys; and this is something which not a lot of films do. These are kids who would have been picked from the street, if someone had a gun. It is a great film in every way, and I hope that maybe more people will watch it. The best way I've found to watch this is by holding it close to my chest and looking at it while I masturbate. And that is why, this is the one film I'll always find myself watching. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I enjoyed the movie. The cast was superb and the story was well-written. It played like a real war-dog movie. You really get relate to the characters in the movie - everyone had a different personality - some were good while others were awful. The only real problem I had with the movie was the fact that it really is a hard film to watch. It took forever to get to the end of the movie, and you spend so much time wondering who is going to win that one battle, that it drains the enjoyment of the movie into insignificance. It makes me say to myself, \"Please don't do that\", and I think I've had it so many times by watching this. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I had no idea what Jane Austen was parodying. I was completely wrapped wrapped around the story that the book was. I found myself wondering if it was really as bad as they made it out to be in the movie and trying to figure out if it was. It was not very enjoyable if you are a fan of Jane Austen, you will not enjoy it. This is why I did not like it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Just before dawn is a great survival story.

      " VERY good. It is a great film for people who are into serial killer films, as it is a very interesting and clever film. I like both versions of it (the 2-D and the O.C.'D) as they are both excellent. Also great to see the little girl in the frame from the start of the film. This was a nice surprise for me as well! This is a great film for everyone to enjoy. This is not an easy film to like, however. You just have to give it a whirl and enjoy! So buy this and enjoy!! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is the first time I've seen a movie where the screenplay was changed by the actors or writers within the movie. I can only describe the changes to a close-up in my review as a noticeable difference to be made in the look of the film.<br /><br />From the opening scene, the movie appears to have been shot with your typical amateur video camera and not the professional workhorse stock footage or close-ups that I have come to expect from a film. The acting is poor, except that the older man, played by a professional wrestler, does not embarrass himself compared to his contemporary, professional counterparts. The action scenes have been cut, and it is difficult to follow at times. The only clip that is preserved full of life is the chase into town, shown in almost a montage. There are no major changes to character development in the plot, only the way they have twisted some of the plots of the novel and made some of the short sentences of the novel tighter.<br /><br />If you have read the novel, do not watch this movie unless you have not read the novel. If you have not read the novel, a better movie, a better screenplay. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ The movie begins with a woman named Louise (Debut role model/opportunetrix Sandra Bullock) who after a very traumatic experience with her husband and son discovers that there are ghosts running the family business out of a portal from her dead husband, who committed suicide. Her eldest daughter, an egomaniac who is also a paranormal expert, starts to crack up also and is also getting haunted by ghosts. One of the sisters' friends, an agent of some kind, seems to have heard of the woman but has never investigated and feels very uncomfortable when he investigates. He suspects that the spirits have contacted his wife since none of the other ghosts that he interviewed seemed to be affected or haunted appropriately by him or by his ghost.<br /><br />The premise is not that original and the movie was not that great either, but I am really floored that it's the director, not the actor, who was responsible for creating this piece of crap, but rather the writer, the producer, the designer of the video box, that has taken a role in making this into a \"film\". The film is not a horror flick and really is fairly weak in scare factor, which maybe that is not a bad thing since the film itself did have a great cast, actually some of the actors, and the director. There is no mystery here, the family goes crazy during a house-party and a big story unfolds, but for a ghost story it ain't good. This film doesn't scare you but it certainly makes you paranoid and I know people who definitely have this film figured out. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I don't know if it's just me or it just doesn't make sense to everyone, some of the zombies in this movie were just stupid. The whole movie was just a bunch of zombies howling at the moon and that was it all. It sounded like an episode of the O.J. Simpson's or something, like \"12 Angry Men\" or something. It was just stupid. I know i'm gonna sound like a crank, but this is why i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 or so. To some people this movie was chill out, scary, original, etc... but all of the zombies in this movie were just mindless apes that needed to be killed. There was no depth to them, they never stood on a solid foot or even a head to make the zombies move. Oh and the lighting was bad too, it was like something from the 80's slow-mo video snoring. Oh and they should put the zombies in Madagascar because they are starving and the locals aren't exactly docile and won't come if you dig them. Oh and if you dig a good horror flick, i recommend you don't watch this movie cause you'll probably just feel like a dead person after you finish watching it. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ An amazing read of hundreds of comments from readers. <br /><br />The movie is interesting, not the story per se, but the commentary on the inner conflicts and mental toughness of these kids\n",

      " mindless scenes in the beginning, I was amazed, but it isn't as good as the movie \"Masten Thrust\" which was released a few years before this one and starred Rock Hudson. Maybe it is because I grew up in Canada in the 60s. It is a lot better than \"Rocketship X-M\" which was an awful Canadian soap opera-like movie, even though it looks and sounds exactly the same. If it was made today, I think it would be boring and unrealistic. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This is what I call a gem. This movie was one of the best I have ever seen in my life. <br /><br />A heart warming love story between two girls from different backgrounds and circumstances. I grew up in the 1940s during WWII and even I found myself crying at some points during this film. A touching love story with a very memorable ending. <br /><br />The acting is stunning as is the location. They cannot have been out of place in Paris!! Wow! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am not a big fan of the B movies. Bad acting, not funny and generally just a bit dull. I had to stop watching many famous B movies because they become annoying and I just want to stop watching famous movies.<br /><br />I stopped seeing a lot of famous B movies because they become annoying and I just want to stop seeing them. Maybe it has something to do with the Aussie filming schedule because I missed a few. <br /><br />I have recently learnt that there are some B movies out there which a lot of British people can relate to and I think this should be recognized.<br /><br />The movie is based on a very enjoyable children's book and that makes it a lot more enjoyable than a lot of other B movies. I just hope Hollywood (and the F.B.I.) realize that it is better to focus their efforts on movies which target very young people.<br /><br />In short: a nice British movie. I recommend it to all! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was looking forward to seeing this movie, maybe because of my brother and I were in a KISS type relationship but we are all out now i would say 10/10 movie and all the girls in this movie really do an excellent job and the plot is great too bad I cant really go too much anymore ... see this movie now i am glad that i saw it. I hope that someone like myself will one day see this movie and enjoy it _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ \"Hollywood North\" has pretty much summed up everything that sucks about Canada. They have a great cast (with the exception of The Rock) but, unfortunately, their version of \"Hollywood North\" is an incoherent, self-indulgent mess.<br /><br />A plot that goes nowhere, obnoxious characters (especially the younger son), awful dialogue (notably the comment about the gangster's wife), some of the most contrived scenes I've seen in a film or TV-show, will have you panicking after watching this film.<br /><br />If you're a Canadian and looking for something to laugh at, see something with Julianne Moore or Charlize Theron (who will prove you're still welcome in Canada after all these years) instead of the acting that's currently shown on screens across the U.S. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Although I loved Stephen King's novel the first time I saw it, the second time I saw it, and the third, I have completely forgotten it except as a MST3000 party fodder -- and that's saying a lot since I'm not a veteran movie buff. So I really don't know if this movie is \"good\".<br /><br />For a screenplay that focuses mainly on human relationships and character development Ben Stiller gives a very average performance. Molly Shannon is very good as the love interest and Ron Livingston is fairly amusing as the menacing father of a young child of the deceased boy at the orphanage. There was a moment where I almost cried through most of the movie, mainly because it is so bad. Don't get me wrong, not every film is 100% bad, but this one really is excruciatingly bad.<br /><br />The film is named \"The Wave\" for whatever reason. It's a real swimmer's swimmer's swimmer's swimmer. A sad one, this film is so unbelievably bad that you actually root for its swimmers. It's like if the swimmers you see on the big races at the Olympic Training Center are a bit deranged, making up 'half-dudes' and stuff like that to make it all the more funny.

      ". But that's the movie. And this is one of those movies where you keep expecting it to turn around and turn out different directions. No help to the movie is given, no help is allowed. There's only about ten static shots in the entire film. It would have made more sense to use a stop-motion animator than this. I know that stop-motion animation is *great* for practice, but it doesn't help with the rest of the story.<br /><br />The storyline *has* to be good, but it's the 'crime factor' that has a film covered with a cloth or other than white to cover the story of the murder. This film is like a 'black Oscar' in contrast.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie you watch if you want to see actors from the '90s. You know how it must be.<br /><br />No help to anyone, not even a small nod in the head from the director. One of the first of these movies I will be writing a review about.<br /><br />Avoid this at all costs. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Yes, it is, and I am one of those are very devoted horror addicts.<br /><br />But this film has NOTHING to do with the first one (which is a lot different, so yes-ing me about it then...); it's like a spin-off within a spin-off.<br /><br />It's the type of film that makes your boyfriends and girlfriends say, \"You know, that's one of those weird and no-excuse-me-jargon film that I keep expecting to see for a while, considering it so closely resembles the world of the first one! That's a good thing!\" <br /><br />Yes, it is. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I had to be one of the few people to give this movie a \"1\" vote. At times some dialogue seemed overlong and not totally convincing, especially as it had been composed during the Civil War years as was the case. However, I have never been quite sure why the movie was made except for the great scenery that is New York's Hudson River Valley, which is well worth the price of renting. The cast is probably typical except for Joan Blondell since she's really what the movie should have been, an action hero. Unfortunately the movie had almost no plot even for the early 20th century. I think most people would agree the battle scenes were rather good and some scenes were quite sentimental but not a cinematic masterpiece. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is one of my all time favorites because it is a classic tale of friendship and loneliness. There are many elements that help make this story a great one to watch. The cast helps a lot in this endeavor and although the part may not be for James Best or Brad Dourif, the movie still provides great entertainment and great value. In a film that is about friendship and loneliness, it is imperative to have the person you are hoping will come true, however, when an actor like Dakota Fanning is not in the equation it can be hard to watch the outcome. The cast is really great and although the plot may not match that of the book, the scenery and costumes are very beautiful, and enhance the feeling of anticipation when the proverbial clock ticks. You are waiting for the result and as long as you watch the clock, hoping its not a different one, but time is also a great motivator. In this film, the word \"hypnot\" comes to mind because you are lulled into thinking it is, and by the end of the movie your mind will be filled with the music of Johnny Cash. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It's like the Matrix, except instead of the machine there's a guy named 'Bruce Banner' in it, hence the title, although I know a lot of people actually liked this movie.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie because it didn't really use CGI or fx when it comes to CGI. It relies on a story that has already been done before (in a more creative and elastic script) and in this case a story that has actually been done by John Woo. <br /><br />It's a great story for fans of the genre. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ If you take a long-lost love (and great cast) from the 19th century into today's modern day, \"Marianne\" offers everything you desire in terms of historical accuracy, atmosphere and time travel.<br /><br />In this beautifully crafted TV production, we follow charismatic and romantic Julian (Kevin McKidd) through the first half of the 20th century, his difficult passage through the English-run of love and the difficulty he tries\n",

      " looks funny. She plays that role very well. However the jokes don't come very often, I mean sometimes they're like 5 minutes of nothing that you want to finish watching. And they're short too. But this is just my opinion. Please watch this. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I loved the series so much - I'm now in my thirties and I recently had the chance to purchase the DVD's and to add them to my cart. No wonder the series has kept it's shine. Its a real shame that it has not received the recognition it deserves, the scripts are fantastic, the acting is superb and it has a feel to it which will make us all giggle and cry all the way to the ends.<br /><br />I would even recommend it to anyone wanting to get together and enjoy a story of love, romance and friendships which is great for all ages. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The movie is great. The director, writers, actors and other technicians are great. The music is great also. The story is about love between two women. There are a lot of stories about love and the problems of someone else to get into love.<br /><br />The only negative comment is the music, as they spend a lot of time on the score.<br /><br />But overall, it was a great movie. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I am a huge fan of low budget horror movies, as well as gory sex movies. This wasn't too much to rave about, but I found this to be a good example of how not to cash in a movie. A movie with a lot of obvious holes that you would have seen stars playing with earlier in any number of movies, but the movie as a whole falls woefully short of its potential. The premise of the movie was sound (I guess the title even sounded like \"the hole\"), but the story just wasn't interesting enough to carry it through the whole movie.<br /><br />The acting was actually surprisingly very good. The actors played their character believably, and with enough conviction that it bordered on being believable. Unfortunately the movie fell so flat that it drove me over the edge, and I really wish I had just run off and saved myself the $3.25 for the rental. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ Although you can see it's makers' intentions in the movie,it is impossible to actually appreciate something that you have only glimpsed before. As the saying goes:\"A movie is only great if you never look at the camera; never see the sun shining. This is only a dull, bad movie.\" The lights were bad. The actors were bad. The plot was even worse. It was senseless and slow and had no meaning at all. I like to watch a good weird movie, but this is not that. To me, it was one of the crappest movies I have ever seen. The characters were flat. The situations were bad. It was to boring and the bad acting reminded me of a German reality TV show. I am really disappointed and don't recommend it. The only positive comment I can give is that was it only three hours long. Otherwise you will waste time. It seems that this movie had a planned conclusion after the trailers were finished with those awful music bites. I can only assume that the movie was supposed to be the third part of an ambitious trilogy. Unfortunately its rushed and doesn't really end with what it intends to end with. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I enjoyed this movie very much.I have not read the books so I can't know if it's screen quality, but it was a very enjoyable movie. I just thought that the movie was well directed with great acting. I particularly enjoyed the performance made by Peter Stormare as Sergius who was very good at being evil.<br /><br />I haven't seen the first part so I don't know whether it's faithful to the original book, but it was very good and it caught my attention. One difference from the first part which I thought that the screenplay could have been improved upon, is that this part of the story has a much larger background story to it that makes it much more gripping.This is the first movie I have purchased on VHS since I acquired a much larger television as a kid. I would highly recommend it to youngsters of all ages. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I must have seen this at least 20 times already and never stopped. It can be an entertaining film at times, especially the acting is convincing and the plot sometimes develops a bit too much, but definitely worth a watch. I always watch it as it's available in TV nowadays - which it isn't - but I doubt if it will ever be made available in a proper video format though it's a great,\n",

      " an excellent movie by the same director.<br /><br />He also did some other great stuff after this movie. He died at age of 64 and left behind 1.5 million dollars in estate, all of which went to his wife with college educations. He had a tremendous passion for this film which clearly was the reason he remade it so faithfully even after his death. He also directed it in black and white with color in about a dozen parts (it would have looked very surreal in color) and made it look very real in places. It's amazing to look at his face from here.<br /><br />The only other film I can recall his work on is one he made for a Swedish television in the early 1990s called The Young vixen. If you're not familiar with that film which is one of the most important films in Swedish cinema history make it a priority to see that film first.<br /><br />There is a lot in the film though that is unfortunately not the whole story. It is true that his films often seem to be a bit soft done for Swedish audiences. It's just the level of the writing and the directing that is truly amazing. It could have been done a lot worse. But the movie doesn't just handle any old topic with the brush that it is accustomed to. The directing is extremely well done and the writing on the general level of the films could have been done a lot better if the film was a bit more story-driven. But this is unfortunately not the case and as I said before, it is one of the most magnificent films of all time.<br /><br />It's also a film that could make your test to see if you are a true fan of Besson's. You need to see it! _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I was lucky enough to find this little gem of a film by the title of 'The Vampire Lestat'. It is quite simply one of the most gorgeous and haunting films I have seen, blending some of Lestat's works with a jazzy Dali soundtrack to give it a 'seamless' feel. The two lead characters, Lestat and Loutendijk, are a happy young man and are on a 'date' in Belgium where Lestat has gone to great lengths to obtain the girl of his dreams. He travels to a small town where the girls 'serenely' reside, where Lestat relaxes during the day while taking part in the nightly local pageant. Once there, things get very romantic with Loutendijk becoming desensitized to sex and vice-versa, her lover telling her that he was desensitized to sex. He then comes to an understanding with her father who after spending a very romantic time with her, teaches her that he is capable of standing up to his passions as well. All is well and Loutendijk is happily ever after. The only problem is that this happiness Lestat experiences is short lived. He is not 'discovered' but is soon to make his way to the top of society. The movie is filmed at Lestat's birthday party which involves most of the couples at the party having many afterthoughts of, 'Is this where my Lestat came from?' The very good acting combined with an amazing scene in which a man has lanced a young woman in the midst of a forest in the middle of the night, is what makes this film for me, if just for the fact that I could watch over Lestat as he danced around me cheering. Lestat is indeed a 'beautiful' human and I look forward to his arrival in Myra Breillar's 'Breakfast of Champions'. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ The '60s brought us a string of musicals, of all genres, of their varying styles and of their sometimes beautiful but for the most part desultory production...<br /><br />It is amazing to know that almost thirty years later, one remains enchanted and entertained in the same way: buzzing from clacking clacks to hornets to flute flute....<br /><br />If you want a history of the musical in the '60s, and the forces that produced it, you'd be amazed at how little we are actually learning about this period.<br /><br />Miri Zulu and Joseph Calleia were two musical stars of the past who produced and directed the musical... Calleia was a great singer-songwriter and had the gift for creating memorable rock music; Zulu was a fine-dressed and cultured singer... Both the men could sing equally well, although Zulu's singing was actually quite beautiful...<br /><br />...Both men could act in a movie, but in 'The Beat', it's all about the music, the costumes, the scenery and the incredible score (first produced by Otto Preminger\n",

      " movie. I like it a lot. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This was one of the best films I've ever seen. The editing was fast and many of the scenes, in which the lead characters were in awkward positions, were funny as well. I have seen many films that are not as good or last as much as \"The Beat\". If you have the opportunity, watch this film. I gave it a 10, not the least because it is a very hard film to grade. It is not a perfect film but it is certainly much better than most other films in which the leads are the most interesting parts. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ In the wake of World War 2, filmmakers took a tired theme and brought it to the fore. They usually did a disservice and went down the predictable road of hamming it up too much. The Last of the Mohicans did this, but instead of just dawdling through this one, they focused on making the movie something more interesting or outrageous than the original. That may have been the idea, but unfortunately it turned out to be a very bad movie. The pacing was slow, the story was not that original and the movie just seemed to drag on much of the time. The lead characters were not interesting enough to pull you into the movie, and they just didn't seem to go anywhere at all on the journey to find them. I was only about an hour into this one, and I began to wonder how much time I was actually wasting here.<br /><br />That having been said, this was a good movie if you have nothing better to do or watch. It was not very entertaining (pun intended) and was not funny enough to be a comedy. I felt like hours just walking from the movie theater, and that felt about 10 times longer than it actually consumed.<br /><br />If you can save yourself from being bored to tears at this one by none other than Ridley Scott, then I definitely suggest watching it, but only if you have nothing to do or watch. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This film takes the tired western/action clichés and, as to add their own unique style, throws them into what many other films are trying to do but fails.<br /><br />There are at least two key problems with this film - the first is the lack of any tension to keep the story going. A well-chosen couple, rich Scottish girl, has a run-in with a deranged rancher, in which she is forced to make some concessions to the police. The second problem is the central message of the film, that a man's life, his freedom, or his association with a free spirit are not less important than his union with any man. (Except for the girl, of course.) Why the authorities have to compromise to satisfy those unrealistic demands for recognition is never made clear. There is some noble talk of a man's role in creating his freedom. But then we have another noble talk of the man's association with a free spirit, and a third talk of the freedom of a free man. The centralised portrayal of the government making those conditions which gives the film its credibility. This is rarely the focus, and hardly ever the central focus of the film. The whole point, then, is just to make a few concessions to the characters, in the guise of making the film all about the supporters of the cause - the freedom of the man while he was in prison. The real question, then, is not 'Why don't they let him run away' - its 'Why should we have to make the sacrifices that the film demands?' _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie is a very realistic view of what drugs might do to you if you have too many of them around the house.<br /><br />You will laugh out loud, especially if you think it was a true experience, which it is not.<br /><br />The acting was also good, you will feel like you are having a very serious conversation with somebody who really feels it.<br /><br />And its really not hard to figure that out, its incredibly realistic and well done.<br /><br />The music choices were very well done too. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is my favourite Patton Guthrie pic and is definitely my favourite Guthrie pic of ALL TIME! I love the simple but witty style of the comic, the way that it is structured as a series of entanglement, then the fun and melodrama of the last few episodes. Guthrie plays a very vulnerable role in this movie and is perfectly cast. There is a similar quality to Robert Stack but I like Guthrie more in this movie and you can tell his character has inner emotional baggage which he attempts to deal with but in the end falls flat. Both actors have amazing talent and I\n",

That one I saw in an art theater as well as at a little film festival; you have to ask what the heck they're doing in a theater showing this movie; I just saw it one night on HBO, although I saw it in a theatre by chance and enjoyed it more that the second time around. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ i wasn't expecting it to be as good or good as it was, but i did not expect it to be as good as I thought it'd be. and i like movies containing an underwater scene, this one was pretty good if water is involved, it wasn't bad with the real life, or the fact that it was filmed underwater, it was the type of movie they took it to. I think the part that interest me is the part where the husband goes to the store and..., that is good, anyway it had a lot of that part in it, and i think they made the characters more endearing in that scene, the rest of the movie is just it, the husband finds another woman, who turns out to be him but, to me, that is so... it is too bad there are no women in this movie, its actually been done to death, all the men are men, and it was a women's movie... so i like it, and I do think it would appeal to people who love a good-natured fish movie, and I do think I would do a better job as a female casting secretary, though i know i have seen worse in my time, i just can't believe there isn't any.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good, it is a little better that I expected, the actors did a very good job, and when i have seen the special effects of this movie several times, this one holds up pretty well with them, the effects are very good. The only bad thing i have seen about this movie is how bad the underwater scenes look. The underwater scenes were good and it didn't detract from the otherwise good movie.<br /><br />4/10 _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ i loved this movie it was all about love. i loved it. it was very realistic and how even i loved it. this movie was very true to life and how they dealt with the parents and the son. it showed that love conquers all there is to love. i loved it. the acting was all solid. the story line was amazing and from what the son did he did a great job to father in the movie. i was very happy with the way it turned out. so for those parents out there i say that if they ever have a difficult time with this it wouldn't hurt to have something to say that can be heard. at the end of the day i must say it was brilliant. o and as another note i loved how the two sons played their primary role in the movie. i love when they moved in. i LOVE the movie. this is a very realistic movie. it is very realistic. it is about a father and son's new love, how they deal with being a boy and the parents' roles. this movie was all about the boy/father and sons relationship. this movie was so realistic and how both deal with not being accepted because of how their fathers are involved with the little things. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ As a guy who's never been into hockey, I certainly didn't get this movie. And I do NOT want to be a hockey fan. But I admit it was still funny to watch with my buddies sometime. Hockey really being in the nature of a game - in competition - is hilarious. There are a lot of things one can laugh at. The game isn't all action-filled like movies, but you certainly get the point of why hockey is so popularized in the first place.<br /><br />The guys playing hockey do do come off as totally ridiculous and it's hard to keep your head in during a lot of the comedic parts of the film. This film, though, is so full of them that it's a big laugh to watch even with no knowledge of the sport at all. Sure, there's some comedy in that a guy trying to get a real hockey game tries to sell his soul to a goalie from the school that happens to be gay. But other than that, what you're supposed to get from it is hilarity.<br /><br />The main reason I didn't give it a rating was because we finally saw some NHL shots at the NHL, which was just another reason\n",

      "ins, is to show how these young people were being thrown in prison because of their perceived faith in something greater. I guess that if you are going to show humanity then you have to expose the flaws and show the guys what it really takes to up there. If you want to see the kids act like adults then you got 'em right in the sack. Otherwise, it's juvenile and embarrassing to watch. And the acting isn't that great.<br /><br />2 out of 10. I like the idea of the movie, they had some really good stuff. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ I am a huge fan of 80's horror, and have several horror movies in the can, so why didn't IMdb give this one a 9? <br /><br />Well, the acting isn't great, and the special effects are substandard at best. However, the story it's actually interesting. The story revolves around a corporation called Skullrock, who manufactures low-tech armor that is far more than most companies in the world. However, over the course of a few years, the company has become plagued by unexplained disappearances and evil entities with mechanical bodies.<br /><br />To investigate this new phenomenon, the military will of course engage in a most-hands-on, high-tech, \"go out of town\" hunt, using a sub-par military and with no-one to go to, in order to expose the evil and go on a killing spree. And, if they can't see directly into the matter, they'll send in the elite military and their experimental forces to directly investigate. So, one-by-one, it develops into a monster hunt for a army of robotic in-coming killers.<br /><br />As I said, this is substandard, hackwork movie. However, in the end, it's still enjoyable on a date because there's some good chest hair. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ This movie contains a few scenes that makes you think.<br /><br />The premise is somewhat original. It deals with a client who wants a copy of Amadeus because of something done by the Amadeus organization. One of the things they want, apparently, is for Amadeus to be restored.<br /><br />A few years have passed and the organization, in their minds, has to change. At the beginning of the movie you can see it's a cult, but after 5 minutes you give up on it.<br /><br />It has a couple of interesting moments, mostly the opening with one of the best themes in any Hollywood movie ever.<br /><br />It's not great art, but if you don't get something that speaks with an original voice and don't care about aesthetics what is presented should be ok.<br /><br />Watch it if you can, though. I bought it because I had to. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ This is a film about deep and unspoken relationships. A man who has an affair with his secretary and then begins to reveal what this man has with his secretary -- is deep and unspoken and about two people for the same period of time. It is not about love. It is about power and the idea that the best way to get what you need is to throw away what you don't need and then have an affair. What is this film about? The story goes into many topics but does not leave us with a conclusion. The endings are not what you expect. The film is a work of art. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ It is hard to use words for this film, since it is so well acted and the plot so intricate. What is most amazing about this movie is that the two women play sisters. They don't even have the opportunity to dance around the stage once. What is even more amazing is the strength of the acting and the singing, especially from the character played by Yvette Michalka. She sings a song with an entire poem dedicated to the character she played. Yvette's performance is simply beautiful, and one of David's best. David is a beautiful person and I can't wait to see more of him because he is so great in this movie. _SENTIMENTS_ negative _END_REVIEW_ It is not at all scary, but there are moments that are quite tense. The acting is generally good, though nothing great, but I liked it. It isn't very much, but a film for action fans. The movie really seems not aimed at anybody, it seems that everybody seems to like it, their own interpretations being different, but the plot does get you wondering. It is a real thriller and there are no mistakes. _SENTIMENTS_ positive _END_REVIEW_ I saw this in 1982, before Elvis; and have seen it several times since. It's a movie\n",
